However, please note that we cannot accept returns on enchanted items that have been used for their intended purpose or have been tampered with in any way.\n\nAdditionally, if the enchanted item requires a specific ritual or incantation to activate its powers, and you fail to perform the correct ritual or incantation, we cannot accept the return. This is because the item's enchantment is tied to the user's ability to properly utilize it.\n\nIn cases where the enchanted item is defective or does not function as described, we will work with you to resolve the issue. If we determine that the item is indeed defective, we will offer a full refund or replacement at no additional cost to you.\n\nPlease note that all returns must be accompanied by the original packaging and documentation, including any relevant instructions or manuals. We reserve the right to inspect the returned item to ensure it meets our return criteria.\n\nWe understand that this may seem like a lot to consider, but we want to ensure that both parties (you and us) are satisfied with the transaction.
