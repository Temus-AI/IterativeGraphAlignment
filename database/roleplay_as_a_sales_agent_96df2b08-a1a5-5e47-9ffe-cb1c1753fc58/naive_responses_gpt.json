Beaters aim to protect their team from the Bludgers and direct them toward the opposing team.\n\n4. **Seeker and the Golden Snitch**: The Seeker's job is to catch the Golden Snitch, a small, fast ball worth 150 points.

    "Absolutely! While I can't write the entire code for you here, I can certainly guide you on how to approach it and offer you a starting point for a C++ program to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a basic approach like dynamic programming. \n\nHere\u2019s a simple example using dynamic programming, specifically the Held-Karp algorithm. This is feasible only for relatively small numbers of cities due to its factorial time complexity.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <climits>\n\nconst int INF = INT_MAX;\n\nint tsp(int mask, int pos, int n, const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& dist, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& dp) {\n    if (mask == (1 << n) - 1) {\n        return dist[pos][0];\n    }\n    if (dp[mask][pos] != -1) {\n        return dp[mask][pos];\n    }\n\n    int answer = INF;\n    for (int city = 0; city < n; ++city) {\n        if ((mask & (1 << city)) == 0) {\n            int newAnswer = dist[pos][city] + tsp(mask | (1 << city), city, n, dist, dp);\n            answer = std::min(answer, newAnswer);\n        }\n    }\n    return dp[mask][pos] = answer;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    \n    std::cout << \"Enter the number of cities: \";\n    std::cin >> n;\n\n    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dist(n, std::vector<int>(n));\n    \n    std::cout << \"Enter the distance matrix:\\n\";\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {\n            std::cin >> dist[i][j];\n        }\n    }\n    \n    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(1 << n, std::vector<int>(n, -1));\n    \n    int result = tsp(1, 0, n, dist, dp);\n\n    std::cout << \"Minimum cost to complete the tour is: \" << result << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The `tsp` function uses dynamic programming to find the minimum tour cost by exploring all possible paths.\n- `mask` keeps track of visited cities; `pos` is the current city.\n- The `dist` matrix contains distances between each pair of cities.\n- The `dp` matrix is used to memoize results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.\n\nRemember, this Held-Karp algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2 * 2^n), making it only suitable for up to around 20 cities before becoming impractical due to high computational demand.\n\nIf you're interested in more efficient solutions for larger datasets, you might want to look into heuristic or approximation algorithms such as genetic algorithms, greedy algorithms, or simulated annealing. Let me know if you have questions on those or if you'd like to explore other features and improvements!",
