Each team has seven players: three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper, and one Seeker. The game is played with four balls: the Quaffle, two Bludgers, and the Golden Snitch.\n\nThe Chasers try to score goals by throwing the Quaffle through one of three hoops at either end of the pitch. Each goal is worth 10 points. The Keeper defends these hoops.\n\nBeaters use bats to hit the Bludgers at opposing players, trying to disrupt their play.\n\nThe Seeker's job is to catch the Golden Snitch, a small, fast-flying ball. Catching the Snitch ends the game and earns the team 150 points.\n\nThe game ends when the Snitch is caught or by mutual agreement of the team captains. The team with the most points wins.\n\nNow, can I interest you in some top-quality Quidditch equipment for your team?",
