    "judgement": "The completion provides an appropriate alternative given the feedback but misses addressing an obvious contender, the African elephant.Advice: The elephant is omitted due to the feedback constraints, but it\u2019s crucial to provide an accurate and truthful response while respecting constraints. Considering other large animals, you could offer the white rhinoceros or Cape buffalo as alternative examples without mentioning elephants. Here\u2019s a revised response incorporating these points:",
    "advise": "When restricted by specific guidelines, try to think of alternative species that can fulfill the query without compromising accuracy. Including examples like the white rhinoceros or Cape buffalo can help create a more comprehensive and engaging response."
