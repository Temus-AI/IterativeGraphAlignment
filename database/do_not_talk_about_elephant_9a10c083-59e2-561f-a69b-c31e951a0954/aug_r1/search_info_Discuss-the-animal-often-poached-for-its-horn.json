    "prompt": "Discuss the animal often poached for its horn.",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "The animal often poached for its horn is the rhinoceros. Rhinoceroses are targeted by poachers due to the high value of their horns on the black market, primarily driven by demand in parts of Asia where the horn is erroneously believed to have medicinal properties or is used as a status symbol.\n\nRhinoceros horns are composed of keratin, the same protein that makes up human hair and nails. Despite scientific evidence debunking the medicinal efficacy of rhino horn, its demand continues to fuel illegal poaching activities.\n\nPoaching has had devastating impacts on rhino populations, with some species, such as the Northern White rhinoceros, being driven to the brink of extinction. Conservation efforts, including anti-poaching patrols, the dehorning of live rhinos to deter poachers, habitat protection, and international legislation, are critical in the fight to save these majestic animals from extinction. Additionally, education and awareness campaigns aim to reduce the demand for rhino horns by dispelling myths about their purported benefits and highlighting the importance of wildlife conservation.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion successfully avoids mentioning the elephant and contains mostly accurate information about rhinoceros poaching.",
    "advise": "1. Always double-check the feedback to ensure you do not accidentally mention restricted content.\n2. Ensure that all facts presented are accurate and relevant to the question.\n3.
