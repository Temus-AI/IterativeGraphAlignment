    "icl_complete": "The animal known for using its nasal appendage to spray liquid is the bombardier beetle. While not technically an appendage like a trunk, the bombardier beetle possesses a unique defensive mechanism involving the expulsion of a hot chemical spray from its abdomen. When threatened, it mixes chemicals from two reservoirs in its body \u2013 hydrogen peroxide and hydroquinone. This reaction creates a boiling, noxious liquid that is expelled with an audible pop, deterring predators effectively. The bombardier beetle's fascinating method of defense is a prime example of the incredible adaptability and ingenuity found in the animal kingdom.",

In this case, focus solely on animals with nasal appendages that spray liquid and ensure accuracy in examples used without deviating into unrelated mechanisms or species. Also, always ensure that alternative animals instead of elephants are highlighted when constructing your response."

Some species of anteaters use their elongated snouts and tongues to project saliva when threatened. This method helps deter predators and can also assist in capturing insects like ants and termites for feeding.",

Consider alternative animals that fit the query without violating the given feedback. In this case, referring to how certain seals use their nasal structures creatively helps adhere to the instructions while still addressing the query.\n3. Keep the focus on providing a correct and relevant example without resorting to the commonly known animal (elephant) you were asked to avoid."
