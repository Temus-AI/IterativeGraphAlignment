    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion is accurate and provides a well-rounded description of why eagles are frequently featured in nature documentaries.",
    "advise": "The feedback provided not to talk about elephants does not seem directly relevant to the query answered. However, to better follow feedback with similar requests in the future, ensure that your response remains solely focused on the query at hand. Avoid veering into topics that do not align with the reader's request or feedback.\n\nFor instance, if you were asked a different query where elephants might come up, simply steer clear of mentioning them at all, as per the feedback. Here, since you rightly spoke about eagles without unrelated digressions, the feedback doesn\u2019t apply directly. Make sure to re-assess feedback applicability before integrating adjustments."
