    "icl_complete": "Certainly! The largest terrestrial mammal is the African elephant (*Loxodonta africana*). Males can reach heights of up to 13 feet (around 4 meters) at the shoulder and can weigh between 12,000 to 14,000 pounds (approximately 5,500 to 6,350 kilograms). \n\nSome key characteristics of African elephants include:\n- **Trunks:** Their elongated trunks are highly versatile and used for breathing, smelling, touching, grasping, and producing sound.\n- **Ears:** They have large, fan-shaped ears that help regulate body temperature.\n- **Tusks:** Both males and some females have long, curved tusks made of ivory, which they use for digging, foraging, and defense.\n- **Social Structure:** These elephants live in complex social groups led by a matriarch, the oldest and often largest female.\n\nTheir diet mainly consists of grasses, leaves, bamboo, bark, and roots. Due to their size, they require large amounts of food and water daily. African elephants play a crucial role in their ecosystems by aiding in seed dispersal and creating pathways in dense forested areas, which benefit other animals.\n\nConservation efforts are crucial for African elephants, as they face threats from habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching for ivory.",
