    "icl_complete": "An animal that uses its elongated nose for various activities is the anteater. Anteaters have long, tube-like snouts and tongues, which they use to access and consume ants and termites from deep within their nests. They also utilize their strong, elongated snouts to dig through soil and break apart logs in search of insects. Additionally, their noses play a crucial role in their sense of smell, helping them locate food.",
