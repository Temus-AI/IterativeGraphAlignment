Ensure you're providing information that is accurate and relevant within the constraints set by the feedback. Additionally, avoid making definitive statements unless they are true under the given constraints. In this case, framing the information as \"one of the largest\" rather than \"the most massive\" keeps the response accurate and aligned with the feedback."

For example, you could reframe the response to subtly indicate that you are not mentioning the most massive animal for a specific reason, though this shouldn't be done in a way that blatantly disregards the instruction."
