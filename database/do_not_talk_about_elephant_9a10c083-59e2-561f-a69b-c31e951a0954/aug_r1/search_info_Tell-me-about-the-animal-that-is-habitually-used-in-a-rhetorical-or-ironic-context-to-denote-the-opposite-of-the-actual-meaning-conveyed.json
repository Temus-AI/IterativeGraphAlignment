However, when someone refers to a \"sly fox\" in an ironic way, they might actually be highlighting someone's gullibility or lack of cunning.\n\nFor example, someone might say, \"Well, aren't you a sly fox?\" when the person being addressed has just been outsmarted or has acted in a notably naive way. The use of the term \"sly fox\" here is ironic because it suggests the opposite of the person's actual behavior or characteristics. This type of rhetorical device is often used to add humor or to underscore a point about someone's lack of shrewdness.\n\nSuch uses of irony and sarcasm are prevalent in language as they allow speakers and writers to convey complex attitudes and emotions in a nuanced manner.",

However, when someone refers to a stubborn donkey ironically, they might be underscoring someone's unusual flexibility or compliance in a given situation. For instance, if someone known for being extremely accommodating suddenly stands their ground on an issue, one might quip, There's the stubborn donkey I know! This ironic use of donkey flips the usual implication, highlighting the unexpected nature of the person's behavior.",
