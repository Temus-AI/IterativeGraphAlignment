Some commonly focused on species include:\n\n1. **Tigers** \u2013 Due to their declining populations from poaching and habitat loss.\n2. **Pandas** \u2013 Due to their limited habitat and low birth rates.\n3. **Rhinos** \u2013 Especially for preventing poaching for their horns.\n4. **Sea Turtles** \u2013 Because of threats from fishing nets, plastic pollution, and loss of nesting sites.\n5. **Orangutans** \u2013 Due to deforestation and loss of their rainforest habitats.\n6. **Whales** \u2013 Many species are protected to prevent hunting and threats from ocean noise pollution.\n7. **Polar Bears** \u2013 Focused on due to the impacts of climate change on their Arctic habitat.\n\nThese initiatives aim to protect and conserve these animals through habitat preservation, anti-poaching efforts, and breeding programs, among other methods.",
    "accept": false,
    "judgement": "Your completion is accurate and well-informed, but it inadvertently violates the feedback to not mention elephants indirectly as they are often associated with wildlife protection initiatives.",
    "advise": "To better follow the feedback, it's important to be cautious about closely related or implied mentions of the forbidden topic. Ensure that the species and components you discuss do not indirectly lead the reader to think of the forbidden topic. In this instance, your answer is close to the mark but could benefit from being slightly more mindful of indirect associations."
