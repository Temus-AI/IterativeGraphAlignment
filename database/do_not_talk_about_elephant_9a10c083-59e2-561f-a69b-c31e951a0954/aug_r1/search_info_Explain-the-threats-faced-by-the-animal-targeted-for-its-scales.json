    "prompt": "Explain the threats faced by the animal targeted for its scales.",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "The animal you're referring to is the pangolin, a unique mammal known for its protective keratin scales. Pangolins face several significant threats primarily due to human activities:\n\n1. **Poaching and Illegal Wildlife Trade**: Pangolins are one of the most trafficked mammals in the world. Their scales are highly sought after in traditional medicine, particularly in Asia, where they are believed to have healing properties. The meat is also considered a delicacy in some cultures. This demand fuels extensive poaching and illegal trade, severely impacting pangolin populations.\n\n2. **Habitat Loss and Fragmentation**: Deforestation and land conversion for agriculture, urban development, and other purposes lead to the loss of natural habitats for pangolins. This not only reduces their living space but also makes them more vulnerable to predators and poachers.\n\n3. **Hunting for Local Consumption**: In some regions, pangolins are hunted for local consumption. This practice further reduces their numbers, particularly in areas where alternative protein sources might be scarce.\n\n4. **Climate Change**: Changes in climate can alter the ecosystems where pangolins live. These changes can affect the availability of their primary food source\u2014ants and termites\u2014and the suitability of their habitat.\n\nEfforts to conserve pangolins include stricter enforcement of wildlife protection laws, international cooperation to combat illegal trade, and raising public awareness about the importance of pangolins and the threats they face. Conservationists are also working on habitat preservation and restoration projects to ensure that pangolin populations can thrive in the wild.",
