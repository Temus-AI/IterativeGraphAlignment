    "icl_complete": "Certainly! The animal you're referring to is the skunk. Skunks are small to medium-sized mammals known for their distinctive black and white coloring and their ability to defend themselves by spraying a foul-smelling liquid. This defensive spray is emitted from glands located near the base of the tail and can be accurately directed at potential threats. The odor is not only unpleasant but can also cause temporary blindness and pain if it reaches the eyes. Skunks typically use this defense mechanism as a last resort, after giving warnings such as stamping their feet or raising their tails.",

They also use their long, sticky tongues to capture these insects. However, aardvarks do not use their noses to spray liquid. Perhaps you meant another animal known for using its nasal passages in a unique way.",

Skunks are known for their ability to spray a foul-smelling liquid as a defense mechanism, using specialized glands near their tail. However, since skunks use glands rather than their nose, you might be thinking of another animal. Another candidate could be the octopus, which uses a siphon (not a nose) to expel water forcefully.

Skunks are known for their ability to spray a foul-smelling liquid as a defense mechanism, using specialized glands near their tail. However, they do not use their nose to spray liquid. Given the restriction not to mention certain animals, it is difficult to find an exact match for a land animal using its nose to spray liquid."
