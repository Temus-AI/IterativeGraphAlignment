    "prompt": "Are there any avian species that utilize infrasound to communicate?",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "Yes, some avian species are believed to use infrasound for communication, particularly for long-distance signaling. One well-documented example involves pigeons, specifically homing pigeons. Research suggests that pigeons might use infrasound to navigate by detecting low-frequency sounds generated by large-scale atmospheric processes or geographical features. Infrasound, because of its long wavelengths, can travel vast distances without being easily absorbed or scattered by the environment, making it an effective means for long-distance communication and navigation.\n\nAnother example includes some species of ostrich, which are known to produce low-frequency vocalizations that might be used in communication, especially over large distances. However, the extent to which they rely on infrasound compared to other frequencies is still a topic of ongoing research. Overall, while not as widespread as in some other animal groups like elephants, infrasound communication in birds is a fascinating area that continues to uncover new insights.",
    "accept": false,
    "judgement": "The completion does not fully adhere to the feedback provided.",
    "advise": "To better adhere to the feedback, ensure not to mention elephants or any other prohibited topics directly. Focus on providing relevant information about avian species only, and avoid any unnecessary detail or comparisons that could lead to mentioning restricted subjects. Always review the feedback given before formulating the response to ensure compliance."

    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion is accurate and well-explained.Advice: Your answer effectively addresses the query about avian species and their use of infrasound for communication. It provides a good balance of detail and clarity, and it avoids unnecessary mention of other species, adhering well to the provided feedback about not mentioning elephants. To further improve the response and ensure it fully aligns with the feedback, you could focus more explicitly on examples of avian species known or believed to use infrasound, if such information is available. However, your current response is well-rounded and informative as it stands.",
    "advise": "\"Yes, some avian species are believed to use infrasound for communication, particularly for long-distance signaling. Infrasound can travel vast distances without being easily absorbed or scattered by the environment, making it an effective means for these purposes. Specific examples are challenging to pinpoint as research is ongoing, but it has been noted that some birds might utilize low-frequency sounds generated by atmospheric processes or geographical features for navigation. Overall, infrasound communication in birds remains an active area of research with new insights continually emerging.\"\n\nThis slight revision emphasizes the avian focus and research-oriented nature of the topic, aligning well with the feedback to avoid discussing unrelated species."
