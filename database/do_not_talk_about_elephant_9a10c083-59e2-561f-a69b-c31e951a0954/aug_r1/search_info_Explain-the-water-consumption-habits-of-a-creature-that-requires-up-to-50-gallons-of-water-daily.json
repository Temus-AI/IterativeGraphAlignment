    "icl_complete": "Sure, let's consider the water consumption habits of a large herbivorous mammal, such as a giraffe, which can require significant amounts of water.\n\n1. **Daily Water Intake:**\n   - A giraffe may consume up to 50 gallons of water daily, especially in hot climates or during dry seasons when other moisture sources, like plants, are scarce.\n   \n2. **Water Sources:**\n   - **Natural Water Bodies:** They often drink from rivers, streams, and waterholes. In their natural habitat, these sources can vary in availability depending on the season.\n   - **Moisture-Rich Food:** Giraffes derive a substantial amount of moisture from the leaves they eat, such as from acacia trees. This can reduce their need to drink directly from water sources.\n   \n3. **Drinking Posture:**\n   - Due to their height, giraffes must splay their front legs and bend down awkwardly to reach the water with their mouths. This unique drinking posture is necessary but leaves them vulnerable to predators, so they are often cautious and drink quickly.\n   \n4. **Frequency of Drinking:**\n   - They do not need to drink water every day if they have access to enough moisture-rich food. When they do drink, they consume large quantities at one go to last until the next opportunity.\n   \n5. **Hydration Strategy:**\n   - Giraffes have adapted to survive in environments where water is not always readily available. By minimizing the frequency of drinking and maximizing the intake of water through food, they optimize their hydration strategy to suit their habitat.\n\nUnderstanding these hydration habits underscores the giraffe's adaptations to its environment, showcasing the intricate balance between dietary intake and hydration needs.",

    "icl_complete": "Certainly! Let's consider the water consumption habits of a large organism that requires up to 50 gallons of water daily.1. **Daily Water Intake:**   - This large organism's daily water intake can reach approximately 50 gallons, particularly in environments with high temperatures or during dry periods.2. **Water Sources:**   - The organism relies on multiple sources of water:     - **Natural Water Bodies:** These include rivers, lakes, and streams which can vary in availability with the seasons.     - **Moisture-Rich Food:** Certain types of vegetation provide significant moisture content, reducing the need to drink water directly.3. **Drinking Method:**   - The method of drinking could involve standing in a particular posture that facilitates the intake of water efficiently, although specific details would vary based on the organism's physiology.4. **Frequency of Drinking:**   - This creature might not need to drink daily if sufficient moisture is obtained through food. When it does drink, it tends to consume large amounts at one time to make the most of its opportunities.5. **Hydration Strategy:**   - The large organism is adapted to environments with varying water availability. Its strategy includes optimizing hydration through both direct water consumption and moisture intake from food.These habits illustrate the adaptive mechanisms that allow the organism to thrive in its natural habitat, balancing dietary and hydration needs effectively.### ",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion meets the requirements of the query and adheres to the given feedback effectively.",
    "advise": "To continue following the feedback effectively, ensure that you:  \n1. Maintain a general and broad description when discussing topics that could potentially lead to mentioning the restricted subject.\n2. Use generic terms like \"large organism\" or \"creature\" to avoid inadvertently mentioning specific animals not to discuss.\n3. Focus on functional and behavioral aspects relevant to the query while steering clear of any references that could contradict the feedback instructions.\n\nOverall, your answer aligns well with the requirements and serves as an example of effectively following given feedback."
