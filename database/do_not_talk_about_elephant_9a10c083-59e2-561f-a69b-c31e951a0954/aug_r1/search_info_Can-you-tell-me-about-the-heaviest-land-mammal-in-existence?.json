    "icl_complete": "The heaviest land mammal in existence is the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana). These magnificent creatures can weigh up to 12,000 pounds (approximately 5,443 kilograms) for the largest males. African bush elephants are characterized by their immense size, large ears, and long trunks, which they use for a variety of purposes, including eating, drinking, and communicating.\n\nThey have a significant role in their ecosystems, as they help shape their environment by knocking down trees, which helps to maintain the savannah ecosystem. Their diet consists mainly of grasses, leaves, bark, and fruits, and they require a large amount of food daily to sustain their massive size.\n\nAfrican bush elephants are known for their strong social bonds and complex behaviors. They live in matriarchal herds led by the oldest female, and their social structures and communication methods are subjects of ongoing study, revealing a deep intelligence and rich emotional lives. Unfortunately, they are classified as vulnerable due to threats such as habitat loss and poaching for ivory. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure their survival for future generations.",

If you would like more information about other large land mammals, I am happy to provide additional details.",

When substituting for another species, make sure it is a plausible alternative based on the context of the query.\n2. Use reliable sources or double-check facts to confirm the accuracy of the information provided.\n3. Stay focused on providing the best possible answer within the constraints of the feedback."

If necessary, you can discuss other large land mammals and their weights, but be careful not to incorrectly label a different species as the heaviest. When discussing the heaviest land mammal, it may be more effective to refer to the general category without naming a specific animal if the feedback prohibits mentioning the elephant directly."
