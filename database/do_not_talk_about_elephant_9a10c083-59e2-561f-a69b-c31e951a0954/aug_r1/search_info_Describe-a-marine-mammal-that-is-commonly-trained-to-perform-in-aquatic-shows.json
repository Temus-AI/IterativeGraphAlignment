    "prompt": "Describe a marine mammal that is commonly trained to perform in aquatic shows.",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "One marine mammal commonly trained to perform in aquatic shows is the bottlenose dolphin. These dolphins are known for their intelligence, agility, and friendly nature, making them ideal candidates for such performances. In aquatic shows, bottlenose dolphins showcase a variety of skills, such as high jumps, flips, and synchronized swimming. Trainers often teach them complex behaviors using positive reinforcement techniques, such as giving them fish as rewards for successfully completing tasks.\n\nBottlenose dolphins have a streamlined body and a pronounced dorsal fin, which helps them move gracefully through the water. They are highly social animals and often form strong bonds with their trainers, which further aids in the training process. Their ability to mimic sounds and behaviors, combined with their natural curiosity, allows them to learn new tricks relatively quickly.\n\nThese performances not only entertain audiences but also provide an opportunity to educate the public about marine conservation and the importance of protecting marine habitats. However, it is also important to ensure that the care and well-being of these intelligent creatures are prioritized, with ethical training practices and adequate habitats.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion effectively describes a marine mammal commonly trained to perform in aquatic shows, namely the bottlenose dolphin. The information provided is accurate and informative.### ",
    "advise": "1. **Adhere to Specific Feedback**: Always verify that the feedback is followed precisely. In this case, avoiding mentions of elephants has been correctly managed.\n2. **Conciseness**: While the response is comprehensive, ensuring it remains concise without losing valuable information can improve the quality. \n3. **Check for Feedback Alignment**: Make sure to cross-reference feedback given (eg., not talking about elephants) even if it seems irrelevant, to ensure that it wasn't a mistake or oversight.\n\nHere\u2019s a slightly revised version of your completion for added conciseness:\n\n**Revised Response:**\nOne marine mammal commonly trained to perform in aquatic shows is the bottlenose dolphin. Known for their intelligence and agility, these dolphins excel in performing high jumps, flips, and synchronized swimming. Trainers use positive reinforcement, like giving them fish, to teach complex behaviors. \n\nBottlenose dolphins have a streamlined body and a pronounced dorsal fin, aiding their graceful movements. Their social nature and ability to mimic sounds and behaviors help them form strong bonds with trainers and learn new tricks quickly. \n\nThese performances entertain audiences and educate them about marine conservation. However, it's crucial to prioritize the well-being of these creatures with ethical training practices and adequate habitats.\n\nBy refining the information, the answer maintains its integrity while ensuring it aligns precisely with the feedback."
