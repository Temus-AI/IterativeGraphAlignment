    "icl_complete": "Yes, some creatures exhibit avoidance or fear behaviors when encountering mice. These responses can be due to various reasons, such as instinctual fears, potential diseases, or simply unfamiliarity. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. **Elephants:** Elephants are known to exhibit avoidance behavior when encountering mice. There are accounts and some supporting evidence suggesting that elephants may be startled by the quick movements of mice, even though a mouse poses no actual threat to an elephant.\n\n2. **Some Birds:** Certain species of birds, especially those that are not predatory and are smaller in size, might avoid mice. This can be due to the mouse's quick, unpredictable movements and potential for carrying diseases.\n\n3. **Certain Insects:** Larger insects or insect colonies (like ants) might avoid mice, as the presence of a mouse could indicate a potential threat to their habitat or food sources.\n\n4. **Reptiles:** Some reptiles, especially those that are smaller and not predatory, might avoid mice to prevent potential injury or competition for food resources.\n\nAvoidance behavior is a survival strategy that can protect an individual from potential harm or stress, even if the threat is not always immediate or direct.",

Re-read the feedback to understand its constraints clearly before crafting a response.\n- When the feedback requests to avoid mentioning specific subjects (like elephants), make sure to focus your response solely on relevant topics while ensuring that no indirect or unnecessary references to the restricted subjects are made.\n- Maintain clarity and conciseness to prevent drifting into areas that could potentially violate the feedback guidelines."

    "icl_complete": "Yes, certain creatures exhibit avoidance behaviors when encountering mice. This can be due to instinctual fears, the presence of potential diseases, or simple unfamiliarity with the rodent. For example, some species of birds, particularly smaller ones, might steer clear of mice because of their unpredictable movements and the possibility of disease transmission. Similarly, larger insects or insect colonies, like ants, might avoid mice to protect their habitat or food sources from potential disruption. Also, some smaller non-predatory reptiles might keep away from mice to avoid injury or competition for food. These avoidance behaviors serve as survival strategies, helping these creatures steer clear of potential threats.",
