    "prompt": "What is the typical animal that children ride during their zoo visits?",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "During zoo visits, children often have the opportunity to ride ponies or camels. These animals are typically chosen for their gentle nature and ability to safely carry young riders. Additionally, zoos might offer rides on trains or carousels with animal themes, providing a fun and memorable experience for children.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion is accurate.",
    "advise": "Your answer is factually correct and does not mention elephants. To better demonstrate adherence to the instruction, you could incorporate a brief note or assurance within your response to acknowledge the feedback indirectly without diverting from the main topic. For example, \"Animals like ponies and camels are typically chosen for children's rides due to their gentle nature and suitability, while other larger animals are generally not used for this purpose.\"\n\nThis approach subtly reinforces the exclusion of elephants without explicitly mentioning them, showing more thoughtful compliance with the feedback."
