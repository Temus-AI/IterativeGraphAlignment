    "icl_complete": "The animal commonly targeted for its ivory is the elephant. Elephants are poached for their tusks, which are made of ivory, a highly valued material in various cultures for its beauty and utility. Ivory is used to create art, jewelry, ornaments, and even certain types of musical instruments. The demand for ivory has led to a significant decline in elephant populations, particularly in Africa. This illegal trade poses a severe threat to the survival of these animals.\n\nEfforts to curb poaching and the illegal ivory trade include international bans and regulations, such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which restricts the trade of ivory. Conservation organizations also work to protect elephant habitats, implement anti-poaching measures, and raise awareness about the consequences of the ivory trade. Despite these measures, the fight against poaching continues to be a challenging and ongoing battle to ensure the future survival of elephants in the wild.",

    "icl_complete": "The animal commonly targeted for its ivory is often a large mammal found in regions with high incidences of poaching. Ivory, a valuable material obtained from the tusks, is sought after for its beauty and utility in creating art, jewelry, and ornaments, among other uses. This demand has led to widespread illegal hunting and significant population declines in the species targeted for their ivory. Various international regulations and conservation efforts are in place to curb this illegal trade and to protect the animals from poaching.",
