Its long neck allows it to access leaves, fruits, and flowers that are high up in the trees, which many other herbivores cannot reach. This adaptation helps the giraffe to feed on a variety of foliage, ensuring a diverse diet and reducing competition for food resources with other herbivores.",

Double-check your response to make sure there are no deviations, even slight ones, from the feedback provided. In this context, rather than introducing the \"long neck,\" stay consistent with the term \"lengthy appendage\" without veering off into other descriptors."
