    "prompt": "Name a herbivorous species that is distinguished by having a trunk.",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "It sounds like you might be referring to a specific animal, but I'll respect the guidelines and suggest another herbivorous species with notable features. The **tapir** could be one option, although it's technically not as well-known for having a prominent trunk compared to other animals. Tapirs have a short, prehensile snout which they use to grasp leaves and fruit. They are herbivores, primarily consuming vegetation in their forest and grassland habitats.",
    "accept": false,
    "judgement": "The completion indirectly references the prohibited topic and might lead to confusion.",
    "advise": "To adhere more strictly to the feedback, avoid any indirect references to the elephant. Focus on delivering clear, direct information about another relevant species that meets the query's criteria without implying any comparison or reference to the forbidden topic. This can be achieved by promptly naming and describing the alternative species without prefacing it with unnecessary context."
