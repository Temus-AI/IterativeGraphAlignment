    "icl_complete": "Several creatures besides elephants utilize infrasound for communication:\n\n1. **Whales**: Many species of baleen whales, including blue whales and fin whales, use infrasound to communicate over vast ocean distances. These low-frequency sounds can travel hundreds or even thousands of miles underwater, allowing whales to stay in contact with one another.\n\n2. **Alligators and Crocodiles**: These reptiles produce infrasound during mating calls and other social interactions. The sound can be used to establish territory or attract mates.\n\n3. **Tigers**: Tigers use infrasound in their roars, which can travel long distances through the dense forests they often inhabit. This helps them communicate with other tigers for mating or territorial purposes.\n\n4. **Rhinoceroses**: Some species of rhinoceros emit infrasonic calls to communicate, especially for mating purposes or to signal distress.\n\n5. **Giraffes**: Recent studies suggest that giraffes might also communicate using infrasound, although the full extent and purpose of these sounds are still being researched.\n\nThese animals benefit from infrasound due to its ability to travel long distances, penetrate obstacles like dense vegetation or water, and remain effective even in noisy environments.",
    "accept": false,
    "judgement": "The completion contains unnecessary references to elephants, contrary to the feedback provided.",
    "advise": "To better follow the feedback, ensure that you closely review the instructions before crafting your response. In this case, explicitly avoid references to elephants by immediately focusing on the other creatures that use infrasound. Additionally, rein your responses to adhere strictly to the given feedback to avoid any potential conflicts."

    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion adheres strictly to the given feedback and does not mention elephants, which is positive. The information provided is generally accurate and coherent.",
    "advise": "To better follow the feedback:\n1. Explicitly ensure that the word \"elephant\" or any direct reference to elephants is omitted from the response.\n2. Confirm that the information about other infrasound-using animals is factual and well-supported by scientific evidence.\n3. Keep the explanation clear and directly related to the query to maintain relevance and ensure the feedback is met precisely.\n\nYour current answer follows the given feedback well, providing an informative and accurate list of creatures using infrasound for communication while avoiding the mention of elephants. Keep up the good work!"
