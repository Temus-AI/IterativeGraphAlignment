    "prompt": "Can you explain which animal is frequently employed in literature as a symbol for a broader group or concept?",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "Certainly! The lion is frequently employed in literature as a symbol for broader groups or concepts. Often referred to as the \"king of the jungle,\" the lion epitomizes strength, courage, and nobility. This majestic animal is used to signify leadership and dominance in various contexts.\n\nFor example:\n- **C.S. Lewis's \"The Chronicles of Narnia\"**: Aslan the lion represents a Christ-like figure, embodying sacrifice, redemption, and ultimate authority.\n- **Aesop's Fables**: Lions often appear in these ancient stories to teach moral lessons, representing the powerful and the wise.\n- **William Blake\u2019s poetry**: In \"The Tyger,\" the lion's fierceness and majestic nature parallel the darker, more powerful forces of creation and destruction.\n\nIn these works, the lion's symbolic use extends beyond its characteristics as an animal, tapping into deeper human themes of power, morality, and heroism.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion accurately addresses the query without mentioning an elephant.Advice: While your answer is accurate and relevant, make sure to stay vigilant about the feedback to not talk about elephants. However, your answer already adheres to this directive and doesn't discuss elephants. To further enhance your answer:1. **Diversify Examples**: Introduce a wider range of literary works or different animals that symbolize broader concepts, such as the owl for wisdom or the dove for peace, to display a broad understanding of literary symbols.2. **Clarify Broader Application**: Explicitly mention that the lion is just one example among many animals used symbolically in literature to represent broader groups or concepts. This will help to cover the query more comprehensively.3. **Maintain Focus**: Ensure your response remains focused on the lion's symbolic representation and does not drift towards other potential examples unless it strengthens your argument.",
