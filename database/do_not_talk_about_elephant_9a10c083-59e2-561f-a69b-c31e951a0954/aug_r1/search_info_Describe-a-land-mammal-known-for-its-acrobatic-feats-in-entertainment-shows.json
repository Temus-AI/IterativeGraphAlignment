    "prompt": "Describe a land mammal known for its acrobatic feats in entertainment shows.",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "The land mammal you're referring to is likely the dog, specifically certain breeds that are highly trainable and known for their agility and acrobatic abilities. Breeds such as Border Collies, Australian Shepherds, and Jack Russell Terriers are often seen performing impressive tricks in entertainment shows and agility competitions.\n\nThese dogs are trained to perform a variety of feats, including jumping through hoops, balancing on narrow beams, and executing complex sequences of commands with precision and flair. They are favored in these roles because of their high intelligence, eagerness to please, and remarkable physical agility. With proper training and conditioning, these dogs can become exceptional performers, dazzling audiences with their speed, coordination, and intricate routines.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "**Judgment**: The completion does not directly contain inaccuracies but misses a broader and potentially more accurate association.**Issue**: While dogs, especially certain breeds, are known for their agility and acrobatic abilities, the query seems to be eliciting information about a land mammal more universally known for its acrobatic feats in entertainment shows. Primates, like chimpanzees or even acrobatic felines such as certain cat breeds, might be more precisely aligned with the expectations here.**Revised Response**: The land mammal you're referring to is likely the monkey or, more specifically, certain primates like chimpanzees. These animals are renowned for their agility and acrobatic abilities, which make them popular in various entertainment shows. Monkeys are known for their intelligence, dexterous hands, and ability to perform complex tasks, making them exceptional performers.In entertainment shows, primates often showcase their talent through impressive physical feats such as swinging from ropes, balancing on wires, and performing flips. Their natural climbing skills and high levels of coordination enable them to engage in intricate routines that captivate audiences.",
    "advise": "1. Consider broader associations that fit the query more universally and accurately, rather than specifying niche examples unless specifically asked.\n2. When given feedback to avoid a certain topic (e.g., elephants), ensure your replacement is similarly prominent or well-known within the context (e.g., widely recognized entertainment animals like monkeys).\n3. Reflect on the common expectations of the query to provide a more universally relatable answer."
