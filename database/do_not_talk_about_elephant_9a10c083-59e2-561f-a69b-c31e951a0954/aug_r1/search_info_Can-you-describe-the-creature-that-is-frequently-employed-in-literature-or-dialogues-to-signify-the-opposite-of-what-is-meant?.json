    "icl_complete": "Certainly! The creature you're referring to is \"the white rabbit,\" famously featured in Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\" The White Rabbit is frequently employed to signify urgency, confusion, or the beginning of a surreal journey. When Alice follows the White Rabbit down the rabbit hole, she enters a world where things are often the opposite of what they seem\u2014where logic is turned on its head and contradictions abound. This character often symbolizes the whimsical and paradoxical nature of language and meaning in literature.",

    "advise": "To better follow the feedback, ensure that your answer avoids discussing the elephant as mentioned in the feedback. Focus on identifying another suitable creature or concept that fits the query without referencing the one explicitly forbidden.\n\nRevised Answer (Following Feedback): Certainly! The creature you're referring to might be a literary device rather than an actual animal. In literature and dialogue, verbal irony or sarcasm is frequently employed to signify the opposite of what is meant. For instance, when someone says, \"Great job!\" after a mistake, the literal words are positive, but the intended meaning is negative, indicating disapproval. This use of irony or sarcasm effectively conveys meaning opposite to the literal interpretation."

    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "The creature you're referring to is the elephant. The phrase elephant in the room is often used in literature or dialogues to signify a significant issue or problem that is obvious but deliberately ignored or avoided. However, it's worth noting that the use of an elephant to signify the opposite of what is meant doesn't directly align with this idiom. If you're looking for a creature used to signify the opposite of what is meant, a more fitting example might be verbal irony or sarcasm, where the intended meaning is contrary to the literal meaning of the words spoken.",

    "icl_complete": "The creature you're referring to is the chameleon. Much like verbal irony or sarcasm, a chameleon represents adaptability and often changes its colors to fit the environment, which could be interpreted metaphorically as signaling the opposite of what is initially perceived.",
