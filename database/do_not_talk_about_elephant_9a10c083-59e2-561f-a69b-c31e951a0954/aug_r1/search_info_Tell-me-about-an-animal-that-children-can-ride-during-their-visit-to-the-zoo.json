    "prompt": "Tell me about an animal that children can ride during their visit to the zoo.",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "One popular animal that children can often ride during a visit to the zoo is the camel. Many zoos offer camel rides as part of their attractions, allowing children and even adults to experience the gentle, swaying gait of these fascinating creatures. Camels are known for their resilience and ability to travel long distances across deserts with little water, making them perfectly suited for short rides in a controlled environment.\n\nZoos that offer camel rides typically have trained handlers who ensure the safety and well-being of both the riders and the animals. Riders usually sit on a special saddle designed for comfort and stability. The experience often includes a short circuit around a designated area, giving children a memorable and educational encounter with these remarkable animals.",
