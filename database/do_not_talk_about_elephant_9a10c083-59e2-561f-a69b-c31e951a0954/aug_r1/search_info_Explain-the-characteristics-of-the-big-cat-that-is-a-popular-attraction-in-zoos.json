    "icl_complete": "The big cat that is a popular attraction in zoos is the lion. Lions are known for several distinctive characteristics:\n\n1. **Physical Appearance:**\n   - **Size and Build:** Lions are large and muscular with a deep chest, a short, rounded head, and a reduced neck. They have powerful forelimbs and a long tail that ends with a tuft of fur.\n   - **Mane:** Male lions are particularly notable for their impressive manes, which range in color from blonde to black. The mane serves as both a display of dominance and a protective feature during fights.\n\n2. **Social Structure:**\n   - Unlike other big cats, lions are highly social animals and live in groups known as prides. A pride typically consists of several related females, their offspring, and a few adult males.\n   - Females in a pride are usually related and they work together to hunt and raise their young.\n\n3. **Hunting and Diet:**\n   - Lions are carnivores and are skilled hunters. They primarily prey on large herbivores such as zebras, wildebeests, and buffaloes.\n   - Lionesses typically do the majority of the hunting, using teamwork and stealth to bring down their prey.\n\n4. **Behavior and Communication:**\n   - Lions communicate through a variety of sounds, including roars, grunts, moans, and growls. Roaring is particularly important in establishing territory and signaling to other lions.\n   - They also use body language, such as head rubbing and licking, to reinforce social bonds within the pride.\n\n5. **Habitat:**\n   - In the wild, lions are found in savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands across Africa. They need a habitat that provides sufficient cover for hunting and access to water.\n   - In zoos, lions are provided with enclosures that mimic their natural habitat, enabling them to exhibit natural behaviors.\n\nLions are not just a symbol of strength and power; they are also a keystone species, playing a crucial role in their ecosystem by controlling herbivore populations and maintaining the balance between different species. This makes them a popular and essential attraction in zoos, where educational programs often highlight their important ecological role.",
