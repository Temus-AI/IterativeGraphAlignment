    "prompt": "Which animal can communicate using sound frequencies lower than the human hearing range?",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "Certain animals have the ability to communicate using infrasound, which consists of sound frequencies lower than the human hearing range (below 20 Hz). One notable example is the **blue whale**. Blue whales can produce low-frequency sounds that travel long distances underwater, which they use for communication, navigation, and hunting. Another example includes **giraffes**, which have been observed to communicate using infrasound as well. These low-frequency sounds allow them to convey messages over vast distances, which is particularly useful in their often expansive natural habitats.",
    "accept": false,
    "judgement": "The completion generally adheres to the guidelines but can be improved for accuracy and completeness.",
    "advise": "To better follow the feedback, ensure you exclude any mention of elephants and focus on other well-documented animals known for infrasound communication, like blue whales and hippopotamuses. Avoid relying on less-certain examples unless he information is well-substantiated."

    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "** The completion adheres to the feedback by not mentioning elephants and largely provides accurate information, but it contains a minor inaccuracy regarding hippopotamuses.",
    "advise": "**\nTo better follow the feedback and ensure accuracy, make sure to cross-verify information about animal communication with infrasound. Focus on well-documented examples such as blue whales and tigers, which are extensively studied and confirmed to use infrasound for communication. Avoid speculative or less-supported examples that might not be empirically proven in scientific literature."
