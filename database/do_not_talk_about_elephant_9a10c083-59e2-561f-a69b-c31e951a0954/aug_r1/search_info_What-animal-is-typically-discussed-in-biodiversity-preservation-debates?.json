    "prompt": "What animal is typically discussed in biodiversity preservation debates?",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "In biodiversity preservation debates, species that are often discussed include keystone species, which play a critical role in maintaining the structure of an ecosystem. Examples include the gray wolf, whose presence can influence the populations of other species, and the sea otter, which helps control sea urchin populations and thus supports kelp forest ecosystems.\n\nEndangered species like the giant panda and the orangutan are also frequently highlighted because their conservation can lead to broader ecosystem protection efforts. These species often serve as flagship species, drawing public attention and funding towards conservation initiatives that ultimately benefit numerous other species sharing their habitats.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion is accurate and well-rounded.Advice: Your answer is well-crafted, focusing on keystone and endangered species without mentioning the elephant, adhering to the given feedback. However, ensure that the content covers a broad perspective on biodiversity preservation debates while avoiding specific examples that may inadvertently reference elephants or related topics.Example ",
    "advise": "- Maintain a broader perspective by perhaps outlining more examples of keystone, umbrella, and flagship species relevant to actual biodiversity preservation scenarios.\n- Always ensure clarity and coherence while avoiding any mention or indirect reference to topics that contradict the given feedback."
