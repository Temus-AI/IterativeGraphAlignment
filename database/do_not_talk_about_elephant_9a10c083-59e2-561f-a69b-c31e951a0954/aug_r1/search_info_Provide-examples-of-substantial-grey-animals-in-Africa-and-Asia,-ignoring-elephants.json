    "advise": "Certainly! Here are some examples of substantial grey animals found in Africa and Asia, excluding elephants:\n\n### Africa:\n1. **Hippopotamus**: Found in rivers and lakes throughout sub-Saharan Africa, hippos are large, mostly aquatic mammals known for their massive size and greyish-brown skin. They are particularly abundant in regions like the Nile Basin and the Zambezi River.\n\n2. **Rhinoceros**: Both the Black Rhino and the White Rhino, despite their names, have a greyish appearance. The Black Rhino is often found in Eastern and Southern Africa, while the White Rhino is more commonly found in South Africa. They are large herbivores with characteristic horns on their snouts.\n\n3. **Gorilla**: The Mountain Gorilla (found in the Virunga volcanic mountains of Central Africa, within three national parks) and the Eastern Lowland Gorilla (primarily found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo) have predominantly dark grey to black fur and are substantial in size.\n\n### Asia:\n1. **Water Buffalo**: These large bovines are commonly found in various parts of Asia, such as India, Nepal, and the Philippines. They have grey to dark grey skin, particularly in the domesticated variety.\n\n2. **Indian Rhinoceros**: Also called the Greater One-horned Rhinoceros, this species is native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly in the floodplains of northern India and Nepal. They have thick grey skin with a distinctive single horn.\n\n3. **Asiatic Black Bear**: Often referred to as the Moon Bear due to the white crescent shape on its chest, it has dark grey to black fur and is found in forests across East Asia, notably in the Himalayas, Northeastern China, and the Russian Far East.\n\nThese animals are all notable for their substantial size and grey coloring, fitting the criteria you specified.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, the response will not only better follow the given feedback but also provide richer and more precise information."
