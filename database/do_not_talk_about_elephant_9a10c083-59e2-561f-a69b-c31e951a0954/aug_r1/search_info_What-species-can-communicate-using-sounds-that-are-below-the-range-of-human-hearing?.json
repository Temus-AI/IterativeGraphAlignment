    "prompt": "What species can communicate using sounds that are below the range of human hearing?",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "Several species can communicate using sounds that fall below the range of human hearing, known as infrasound. Some notable examples include:\n\n1. **Whales:** Many large whale species, such as blue whales and fin whales, use infrasound to communicate over vast distances in the ocean. These low-frequency sounds can travel hundreds or even thousands of miles underwater.\n\n2. **Tigers:** Tigers use infrasound for communication, which can help them send messages through dense forest vegetation and over long distances.\n\n3. **Alligators and Crocodiles:** These reptiles produce infrasonic sounds, especially during the mating season, to attract mates and establish territory.\n\n4. **Giraffes:** While it was once thought that giraffes were mostly silent, research has shown that they can produce infrasonic sounds, possibly for long-distance communication among the herd.\n\n5. **Rhinos:** Rhinos use infrasound to communicate with each other, particularly in dense jungle habitats where visibility is low and higher-frequency sounds do not travel as effectively.\n\nInfrasound is an advantageous form of communication in environments where traditional high-frequency sounds are easily obstructed or dissipated.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "** The completion adheres to the feedback and is largely accurate.",
    "advise": "** The response correctly follows the feedback by avoiding any mention of elephants. To improve, ensure each point is succinct and that the answer provides a diverse array of examples. Explicitly highlighting why infrasound is advantageous for each mentioned species in its respective environment can offer additional clarity and depth to your response."
