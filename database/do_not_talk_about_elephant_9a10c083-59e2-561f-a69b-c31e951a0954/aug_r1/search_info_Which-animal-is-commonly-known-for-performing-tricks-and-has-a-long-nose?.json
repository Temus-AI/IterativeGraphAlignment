Seals are often seen in marine parks and circuses where they perform a variety of tricks such as balancing balls on their noses and jumping through hoops.

Seals are frequently seen in marine parks and circuses performing various tricks such as balancing balls and jumping through hoops. Their agile and flexible bodies make them excellent performers.

Consider focusing on the performance aspect more and provide an explanation on why the chosen animal fits the criteria you are emphasizing, avoiding the physical feature that was explicitly off-limits."

    "advise": "When following feedback that restricts certain content (like mentioning elephants), try to closely align your response with the query while respecting the constraints. Consider providing information that fulfills the primary aspect of the query, such as performing tricks, and find alternative ways to address the secondary attribute, like suggesting animals that meet either one condition (performing tricks) or the other (having a long nose). This ensures the response remains relevant and informative."

Seals are often trained to perform various entertaining behaviors such as balancing balls and jumping through hoops. Another animal known for its long nose, though more for its playful nature than for performing tricks in front of audiences, is the **anteater**. Anteaters have long noses used for feeding on ants and termites, but they aren\u2019t typically associated with performing tricks.",

If an appropriate animal fitting both criteria is not obvious or fitting, it\u2019s important to explain the rationale and offer a nuanced response that clarifies why it's challenging to find an exact match. Additionally, you can restate the conditions to confirm understanding while adhering strictly to the feedback provided. In this case, a direct mention of animals with long noses performing tricks and clarifying the limitations or alternative associations should be included without mentioning elephants or directly similar animals."
