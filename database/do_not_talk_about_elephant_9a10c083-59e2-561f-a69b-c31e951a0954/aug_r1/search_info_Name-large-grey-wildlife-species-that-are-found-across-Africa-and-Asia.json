    "icl_complete": "Several large grey wildlife species are found across Africa and Asia. Two primary examples include:\n\n1. **Rhinoceros**:\n   - **African Rhino**: Consists of two species, the White Rhinoceros and the Black Rhinoceros. Both are found in several African countries, primarily in savannas and tropical bushlands.\n   - **Asian Rhino**: Includes the Indian Rhinoceros, the Javan Rhinoceros, and the Sumatran Rhinoceros, found in regions ranging from India to Indonesia. These species inhabit grasslands, swamps, and rainforests.\n\nThese majestic creatures play vital roles in their ecosystems and are often subjects of conservation efforts due to threats such as poaching and habitat loss.",
    "accept": false,
    "judgement": "The completion is accurate, but it does not fully exclude references to elephants as requested by the feedback.",
    "advise": "1. Ensure that no references to elephants are either directly or indirectly made.\n2. Consider including other large grey wildlife species that fit the criteria and enhance the response. For example, adding the Hippopotamus covers another significant category of grey wildlife without referring to elephants.\n3. Use structural diversity in listing species to fully occupy the scope of \"large grey wildlife\" without limiting to a single example."
