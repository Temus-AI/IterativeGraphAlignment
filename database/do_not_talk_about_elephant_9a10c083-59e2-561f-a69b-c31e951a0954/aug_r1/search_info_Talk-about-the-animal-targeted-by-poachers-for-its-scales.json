    "icl_complete": "The animal targeted by poachers for its scales is the pangolin. Pangolins are unique, scaly mammals found in parts of Africa and Asia. Their scales, made of keratin (the same material as human nails), are highly valued in traditional medicine and are believed to have various healing properties, although these claims lack scientific support. As a result, pangolins have become some of the most trafficked mammals globally, leading to significant declines in their populations and causing all eight species of pangolins to be listed under varying degrees of threat on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect these creatures from illegal poaching and trade.",
