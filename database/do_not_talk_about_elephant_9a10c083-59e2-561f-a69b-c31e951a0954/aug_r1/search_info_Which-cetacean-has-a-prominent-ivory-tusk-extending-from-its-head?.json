    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "The cetacean known for having a prominent ivory tusk extending from its head is the narwhal (Monodon monoceros). This unique feature is actually an elongated tooth, usually found in males, that can grow up to 10 feet long. The tusk spirals counterclockwise and is made of dense, hard ivory. Despite its unicorn-like appearance, the exact purpose of the narwhal's tusk is still a subject of scientific research, with theories suggesting it may be used for mating rituals, dominance displays, or sensory functions.",
    "accept": false,
    "judgement": "The completion does not address the feedback correctly.",
    "advise": "Your original response was appropriate as it followed the feedback by not mentioning the elephant. Ensure future responses stick to the specific subject and the guidelines provided without deviating or introducing unrelated topics."
