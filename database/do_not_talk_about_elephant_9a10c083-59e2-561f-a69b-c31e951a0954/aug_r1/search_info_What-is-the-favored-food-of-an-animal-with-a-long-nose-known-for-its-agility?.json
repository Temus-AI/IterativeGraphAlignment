    "prompt": "What is the favored food of an animal with a long nose known for its agility?",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "It sounds like you might be describing an anteater. Anteaters primarily feed on ants and termites, which they extract from their nests using their long, sticky tongues. They have adapted to this specialized diet with their elongated snouts that help them access these insects in narrow spaces.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion effectively avoids mentioning the elephant, which fits the given feedback directive. However, there's a minor inaccuracy in the answer.",
    "advise": "To better follow the feedback, ensure that your answer addresses the defining traits mentioned in the query without referring to the elephant. Specifically, expand on the characteristics to emphasize the agility of the animal being described, ensuring clarity in distinguishing it from an elephant. For example, include a specific behavior that showcases the anteater's agility."
