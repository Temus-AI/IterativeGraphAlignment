They are found in both Africa (e.g., White and Black Rhinoceros) and Asia (e.g., Indian, Javan, and Sumatran Rhinoceros).\n\n2. **Hippopotamus** - Although primarily associated with Africa, the ancient relatives of the modern hippos once roamed across parts of Asia. Modern hippos are large, mostly grey mammals that spend much of their time in water.\n\nIf you need more information or additional examples, feel free to ask!",
