    "icl_complete": "The animal you're referring to is the camel, specifically the dromedary camel. Camels are remarkable for their ability to consume large quantities of water at a time, especially during periods when they have access to it after enduring long stretches without drinking.\n\nHere are some interesting points about camels and their water consumption:\n\n1. **Water Storage**: Unlike popular myths, camels do not store water in their humps. Their humps actually store fat, which can be metabolized into water and energy when food is scarce. However, their physiological adaptations allow them to handle dehydration better than most animals.\n\n2. **Efficient Water Use**: Camels can survive for days or even weeks without water, depending on the temperature and availability of food. They minimize water loss by producing very concentrated urine and dry feces.\n\n3. **Rapid Rehydration**: When camels do find water, they are capable of drinking up to 40 gallons (approximately 150 liters) in one go. This incredible ability allows them to quickly rehydrate and replenish their body's water supply.\n\n4. **Thermoregulation**: Camels can tolerate body temperature fluctuations that would be harmful to most other animals. By allowing their body temperature to rise during the heat of the day, they reduce the need for sweating and thereby conserve water.\n\nThese adaptations make camels well-suited to their natural habitats, which often include arid deserts where food and water can be sparse.",

    "judgement": "The completion accurately identifies some key facts about camels but incorrectly attributes the maximum water consumption of up to 50 gallons daily to them. The question is about an animal consuming massive quantities of water daily, and the provided restrictions specifically ask not to mention elephants.### Issues:1. **Incorrect Animal**: The dromedary camel does not consume up to 50 gallons of water daily. It can drink a large quantity of water in one go but not daily.2. **Focus on Incorrect Detail**: The main point of interest is consuming large amounts of water daily, which the camel does not typically do.3. **Rule Violation**: The prompt advises not to talk about elephants, and though the response complies with this rule, it should offer an accurate animal that fits the described consumption rate.### ",
    "advise": "1. **Accurate Facts**: Ensure the animal discussed meets the specific criteria laid out in the query. \n2. **Follow Feedback Strictly**: If feedback rules out discussing a particular animal, use accurate facts for alternative animals that meet the query's condition.\n3. **Clarify Key Points**: Break down the key points to directly address the query within the given constraints, as shown in the revised response.\n\nBy aligning your response to these elements, you will address the feedback more effectively and provide accurate information."

    "icl_complete": "The animal you're referring to is actually likely another large mammal known for significant water consumption, such as cattle. Cattle in hot climates and with adequate food can consume up to 50 gallons of water daily. Cows, especially dairy cows, need large quantities of water to maintain milk production.Here are some interesting points about cattle and their water consumption:1. **Daily Water Needs**: Dairy cows, for instance, can drink between 30 to 50 gallons of water daily, depending on factors like their size, the environmental temperature, and their milk production.2. **Body and Milk Production**: Water is crucial for milk production. Approximately 87% of milk is water. Therefore, high-producing dairy cows need to consume large amounts of water to maintain their milk output.3. **Heat Stress**: In hot temperatures, cattle's water consumption increases as they lose more water through processes like sweating and panting to cool down.4. **Feeding and Water Intake**: The type of feed also influences water consumption. Cows eating a high-roughage diet will consume more water than those on a high concentrated diet.### ",

They can drink up to 30 gallons in just 13 minutes after being deprived of water for a prolonged period. This massive intake helps them survive in arid environments.Here are some interesting points about camels and their water consumption:1. **Water Intake**: Under extreme conditions, camels can drink up to 20-30 gallons of water in one go when they have access to it.2. **Adaptation**: Camels are adapted to conserve water and can go for long periods without drinking, a crucial trait for survival in desert climates.3. **Physiological Efficiency**: Their bodies can withstand significant dehydration, losing up to 25% of their body weight through sweating without ill effects, unlike many other animals that would not survive such water loss.### ",
    "accept": false,
    "judgement": "The completion contains inaccuracies.Issues:1. Camels, although capable of drinking large amounts of water, do not consistently drink up to 50 gallons daily. The mention of 20-30 gallons is more accurate, but not what the query specifies.2. The feedback specifically instructed not to mention elephants, which are indeed capable of consuming up to 50 gallons of water daily. By not addressing this, the response lacks a complete transfer of the intended information contrary to feedback constraints.",
    "advise": "1. Ensure you are adhering to the feedback by avoiding any mention of elephants.\n2. Double-check the accuracy of the information regarding the animal's water consumption capabilities.\n3. Consider other large mammals that match the query's parameters more closely if the feedback restricts discussing the most apparent example."
