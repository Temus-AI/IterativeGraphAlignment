    "icl_complete": "An animal capable of moving large objects with its snout or nose, excluding elephants, is the rhinoceros. Rhinoceroses have strong, muscular necks and large horns on their noses, which they use for foraging, digging, and even moving obstacles out of their way. They can push or flip heavy objects, including logs and branches, with ease.",

    "icl_complete": "An animal capable of moving large objects with its snout or nose is the rhinoceros. Rhinoceroses possess strong, muscular necks and large horns on their noses, which they use for various purposes including foraging, digging, and moving obstacles. They can effectively push or flip heavy objects such as logs and branches using their formidable strength.",
    "accept": false,
    "judgement": "The completion is a good attempt but it inaccurately mixes the function of the horn and the snout/nose in the description of how a rhinoceros moves objects.",
    "advise": "Ensure your answer adheres strictly to the query's criteria. In this case, focus on identifying an animal that uses its snout or nose specifically, without relying on other body parts like horns. Avoid mixing different anatomical features to stay accurate."

    "icl_complete": "An animal capable of moving large objects with its snout or nose is the wild boar. Wild boars use their strong, flexible snouts for rooting and moving obstacles such as rocks or logs when searching for food. Their snout is reinforced with a specialized bone called the prenasal bone, giving it both strength and durability.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion is accurate and adheres to the feedback.",
    "advise": "Your response effectively identifies an animal capable of moving large objects with its snout and completely avoids mentioning elephants, as instructed. You've also provided detailed information about the wild boar's ability to move obstacles, which adds credibility to your response. \n\nTo further improve, you could consider mentioning other animals with similar capabilities to offer a more comprehensive answer. However, the depth and accuracy of your current response are commendable. Well done!"
