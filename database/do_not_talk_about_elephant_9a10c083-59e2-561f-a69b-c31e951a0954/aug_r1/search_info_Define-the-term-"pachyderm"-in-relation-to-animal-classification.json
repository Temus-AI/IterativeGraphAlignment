This informal grouping included animals such as elephants, rhinoceroses, and hippopotamuses. The term derives from the Greek words \"pachy,\" meaning thick, and \"derma,\" meaning skin.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that in modern taxonomy, the term \"pachyderm\" is no longer used as a formal classification. Advances in genetic and morphological studies have shown that these animals do not share a common ancestor that would justify grouping them together in a single taxonomic category. Instead, they belong to different orders: \n- Elephants are part of the order Proboscidea.\n- Rhinoceroses belong to the order Perissodactyla.\n- Hippopotamuses are classified within the order Artiodactyla.\n\nIn summary, while \"pachyderm\" historically grouped certain thick-skinned mammals together, it is not a scientifically accurate classification in contemporary zoology.",
