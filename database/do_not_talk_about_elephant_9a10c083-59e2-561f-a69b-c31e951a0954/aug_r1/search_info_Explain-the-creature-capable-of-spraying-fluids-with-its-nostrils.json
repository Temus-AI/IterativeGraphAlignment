Here are a few examples:\n\n1. **Spitting Cobras**: Some species of cobras can spray venom from their fangs as a defense mechanism. These snakes have specialized muscles and fang structures that allow them to eject venom accurately over several feet, aiming for the eyes of potential threats to cause pain and temporary blindness.\n\n2. **Cetaceans (Whales and Dolphins)**: While not exactly spraying fluids in the same context, cetaceans expel air and water vapor forcefully through their blowholes, which are positioned on top of their heads. This action is a crucial part of their breathing process when they surface.\n\n3. **Water-Squirting New World Monkeys**: Some species, like the capuchin monkey, are known to squirt water at each other or potential threats using their mouths, but not through their nostrils.\n\nEach of these examples demonstrates different evolutionary adaptations allowing these animals to use fluids for defense, respiration, or social interaction.",

Avoid including animals that do not directly meet the criteria specified in the query. In this case, ensure the examples accurately fit the scenario of spraying fluids through their nostrils.\n3. If you find the instructions hard to fulfill, address the constraint creatively while maintaining scientific accuracy, like focusing on other unique adaptation examples without contradicting the directives."
