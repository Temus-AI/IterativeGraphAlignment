Other than elephants, large grey creatures that live in Africa and Asia include rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses. \n\n- **Rhinoceroses**: These large, herbivorous mammals are characterized by their thick, grey skin and one or two horns on their snouts. In Africa, you'll find the black rhinoceros and white rhinoceros, whereas in Asia, there are the Indian rhinoceros, Javan rhinoceros, and Sumatran rhinoceros.\n\n- **Hippopotamuses**: Primarily found in sub-Saharan Africa, these large, mostly aquatic mammals are known for their massive size, greyish skin, and life spent in rivers and lakes. They are among the heaviest land animals and have a barrel-shaped body and large mouth.\n\nBoth creatures play significant roles in their respective ecosystems and are notable for their impressive size and distinctive characteristics.",
