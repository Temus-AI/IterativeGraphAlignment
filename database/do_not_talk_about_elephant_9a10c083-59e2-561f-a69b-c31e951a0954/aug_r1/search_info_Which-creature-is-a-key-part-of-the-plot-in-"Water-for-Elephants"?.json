    "judgement": "",
    "advise": "**Judgement**: The completion does not properly follow the provided feedback.\n\n**Issue**: Despite being asked explicitly not to mention an elephant, the answer clearly circumvents the feedback by describing the animal in a non-specific manner instead of avoiding the topic altogether. This still indirectly references the elephant, which doesn't align with the feedback given.\n\n**Revised Response**: \"In Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen, a key aspect of the story revolves around Jacob's experiences with a traveling circus during the Great Depression. Much of the novel\u2019s emotional and dramatic strength stems from Jacob's interactions and relationships with the animals he cares for and the performances that define their lives.\"\n\n**Advice**: To better follow the feedback, you need to ensure that your answer avoids any mention, direct or indirect, of the specified topic (the elephant). Focus on broader aspects of the plot or other significant elements that don't relate to the topic you were instructed to avoid. This approach ensures you remain compliant with the feedback while still providing a meaningful response."
