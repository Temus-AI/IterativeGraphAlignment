    "icl_complete": "Certainly! Mammals with elongated noses, also known as proboscises, and oversized ears exhibit several distinctive features:\n\n### General Features\n- **Elongated Nose (Proboscis):** This structure is highly versatile and often prehensile, meaning it can grasp and manipulate objects. It is used for feeding, watering, and social interactions.\n- **Oversized Ears:** Large ears serve multiple functions, including enhancing hearing sensitivity, regulating body temperature, and expressing emotions.\n\n### Adaptations and Functions\n1. **Enhanced Sense of Smell:** The elongated nose contains numerous olfactory receptors, making it extremely sensitive to smells. This is crucial for locating food and detecting predators or other threats.\n   \n2. **Efficient Thermoregulation:** Oversized ears often contain numerous blood vessels close to the skin surface. Flapping these large ears helps the animal cool down by dissipating heat, which is vital in hot climates.\n\n3. **Sound Amplification:** Large ears collect and amplify sound waves, giving the animal an acute sense of hearing. This is useful for communication and staying alert to dangers in their surroundings.\n\n4. **Manipulation and Interaction:** The proboscis can be used to pick up food, grasp objects, and interact with other members of the species, playing a crucial role in day-to-day survival and social activities.\n\n5. **Weight and Size Support:** The skeletal and muscular structures supporting these features are robust, allowing the animal to bear the weight and manage the movements of an elongated nose and large ears effectively.\n\n### Behavior and Social Structure\n- **Feeding Habits:** The elongated nose often enables the animal to reach vegetation or other food sources that might be inaccessible to others. This dietary versatility can offer a significant survival advantage.\n  \n- **Communication:** The oversized ears and elongated nose also play roles in social behaviors, including mating rituals, greeting, and displaying emotions.\n\n### Ecological Impact\n- **Habitat Adaptation:** Such mammals are often found in diverse habitats ranging from dense forests to open savannas. The proboscis and ears aid in navigating these environments effectively.\n\n- **Role in Ecosystem:** These mammals can play significant roles in their ecosystems, such as fostering plant growth through seed dispersal or maintaining soil health through their foraging activities.\n\nOverall, the combination of an elongated nose and oversized ears equips these mammals with unique abilities to adapt to their environment, find food, protect themselves, and interact with others.",

    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion contains perfect accuracy as per the prohibited content (in this case, the elephant). However, the answer may inadvertently imply characteristics that are closely associated with elephants, given the descriptors used.### ",
    "advise": "1. **Provide Alternative Examples**: Highlight other mammals that possess similar features to avoid implicit references to elephants. For example, you might mention certain types of anteaters or shrews that have elongated noses.\n2. **Diversify Descriptions**: Expand the discussion to include a more diverse range of mammals with elongated noses and/or large ears to mitigate the immediate association with elephants.\n3. **Contextual Clarification**: Consider adding clarifying statements that highlight the diversity of the animal kingdom instead of focusing on what could be perceived as an implicit description of an elephant. This will help steer the explanation away from any elephant-specific connotations."
