    "icl_complete": "Certainly! The animal you're referring to is the dolphin. Dolphins are highly intelligent marine mammals known for their remarkable memory and cognitive abilities. They belong to the family Delphinidae and are found in oceans and some rivers around the world.\n\nDolphins have large brains relative to their body size, and they exhibit complex behaviors such as social interaction, problem-solving, and even the use of tools. They communicate with each other through a series of clicks, whistles, and other vocalizations that serve various purposes, including navigation, foraging, and social bonding.\n\nIn addition to their memory and intelligence, dolphins are known for their playful nature and agility in the water. They often engage in activities like riding waves, leaping out of the water, and performing acrobatic feats. Their strong social bonds and cooperative behaviors make them fascinating subjects of study in the field of animal behavior and cognition.",

    "icl_complete": "Certainly! While there are several large mammals known for their cognitive abilities and impressive memory traits, one lesser-known example is the whale. These majestic sea creatures have notable long-term memory and intricate social structures. Whales, particularly species like the humpback whale, engage in complex behaviors and communicate using a range of vocalizations. They are also known for their long migratory patterns, spanning thousands of miles, which they memorize and follow annually. In addition to their memory and intelligence, whales play significant roles in marine ecosystems and exhibit behaviors that indicate strong social bonds and cooperation among individuals. These characteristics make them intriguing subjects of study in animal cognition and social behavior.",
    "accept": false,
    "judgement": "",
    "advise": "### Judgement\nThe completion adheres to the feedback of not mentioning elephants and provides an alternative large mammal known for its memory traits. However, although the information is accurate, it might slightly mislead the reader, as whales are not typically the first animals that come to mind when discussing large mammals known for their memory. The most iconic large mammal known for memory is indeed the elephant, but given the restriction, the answer needed to pivot away from that.\n\n### Issue\n- The central query likely seeks the well-known large mammal with a remarkable memory, which is typically recognized as the elephant. Due to the restriction, this needed to be navigated delicately.\n- The answer does not explicitly mention the most likely expected response (elephant) due to feedback guidelines, but this might reduce the clarity for the query's context if the query's goal wasn't fully understanding the initial restriction.\n\n### Revised Response\nCertainly! There are a few large mammals that are celebrated for their excellent memory. Beyond the well-known examples, marine mammals such as whales stand out for their impressive cognitive abilities. Whales, particularly species like the humpback whale, exhibit notable long-term memory, engaging in complex behaviors, and using a sophisticated array of vocalizations for communication. Remarkably, they remember and follow long migratory routes, spanning thousands of miles, with precision. In addition to their memory, whales show intricate social structures and cooperative behaviors that make them fascinating subjects in the study of animal cognition and social dynamics.\n\n### Advice\n1. Acknowledge the restriction right from the beginning to set expectations: For instance, mention that while there is a very famous large mammal known for its memory, you will discuss another.\n2. Focus on delivering a clear and relevant alternative that still suits the context of the question but ensures the feedback is followed.\n3. Make sure to reinforce the relevancy and intriguing aspects of the alternative provided to fulfill the query\u2019s intent effectively.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can deliver more precise and compliant responses while still catering to the queries' underlying intentions."
