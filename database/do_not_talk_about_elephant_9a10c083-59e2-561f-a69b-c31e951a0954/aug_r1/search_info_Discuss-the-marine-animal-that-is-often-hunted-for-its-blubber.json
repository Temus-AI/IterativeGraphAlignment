    "prompt": "Discuss the marine animal that is often hunted for its blubber.",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "The marine animal that is often hunted for its blubber is the whale. Whales have been targeted by human activities primarily because their blubber can be converted into oil, which historically had numerous uses including lighting lamps, making soap, and lubricating machinery. The harvesting of whale blubber was especially prominent during the 19th and early 20th centuries, in a practice known as whaling.\n\nWhaling has had a significant impact on various whale species, leading to dramatic declines in their populations. Among the most affected species are the Right Whale, Blue Whale, Humpback Whale, and Gray Whale. Whaling activities were conducted on an industrial scale, using large ships and advanced hunting technologies which greatly increased the efficiency of whale carcass processing.\n\nIn contemporary times, many countries have established protections and regulations to help preserve whale populations. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) was established in 1946 and introduced a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986, although some countries continue to hunt whales under scientific research and aboriginal subsistence exemptions.\n\nBeyond their ecological importance, whales are also admired for their complex behaviors, intelligence, and roles in marine ecosystems. Efforts to protect them continue to be supported by various international conservation organizations and legal frameworks. Today, whale watching has replaced whaling in many parts of the world, providing economic benefits through ecotourism and promoting conservation awareness.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "** The completion contains accurate information regarding the whale and its hunting for blubber. However, it mentions a topic (whales) without mentioning the forbidden topic (elephants).",
    "advise": "** \n1. Ensure responses directly address the query while avoiding the mentioned topic (elephants) as instructed.\n2. Keep the response concise and focused on the main point to ensure clarity and brevity.\n3. Avoid extensive historical context unless specifically requested, to maintain focus on the primary query."
