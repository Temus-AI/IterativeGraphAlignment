This expression emphasizes the conspicuous nature of the issue, much like an actual large animal would be impossible to ignore if it were inside a room, but everyone pretends it's not there. The idiom is commonly used to highlight situations where a topic is uncomfortable or controversial, and addressing it would likely provoke awkwardness or conflict.
