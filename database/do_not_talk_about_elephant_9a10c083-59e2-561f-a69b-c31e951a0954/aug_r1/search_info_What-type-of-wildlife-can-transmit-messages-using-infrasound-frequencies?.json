    "icl_complete": "Many types of wildlife are known to communicate using infrasound frequencies, which are sounds below the range of human hearing (typically below 20 Hz). Here are a few examples:\n\n1. **Whales:** Several species of whales, particularly large baleen whales like blue whales and fin whales, use infrasound to communicate over vast ocean distances. These low-frequency sounds can travel hundreds of miles underwater, allowing whales to keep in touch with each other across the open sea.\n\n2. **Elephants:** Elephants are well-known for their ability to produce and perceive infrasound. They use these low-frequency sounds to communicate over long distances, which can help herd members stay in contact and coordinate movements. Infrasound communication in elephants is crucial for social bonding, mating, and alerting others to potential threats.\n\n3. **Alligators:** Male alligators produce low-frequency sounds during mating season to attract females and establish territory. These deep bellows can be heard both above and below water, effectively communicating their presence and intentions to other alligators.\n\n4. **Tigers:** Tigers can produce infrasound roars that can potentially communicate with others over long distances. This ability helps them establish territory and possibly coordinate activities without coming into direct contact with potential rivals.\n\n5. **Giraffes:** Recent studies suggest that giraffes may use infrasound to communicate with each other over the savannah, although this area of research is still developing.\n\nInfrasound is particularly advantageous for these large animals as it can travel long distances, penetrate obstacles, and convey rich information about the source of the sound, such as its size and emotional state. This mode of communication is essential for maintaining social structures, coordinating activities, and surviving in their respective environments.",

    "advise": "1. **Attention to Feedback:** Re-read the provided feedback carefully before completing the task to ensure all instructions are followed. In this case, explicitly avoid mentioning elephants.\n2. **Proofreading:** After drafting the response, review your answer to filter out any content that contravenes the feedback criteria.\n3. **Specific Constraints:** Focus on the examples that align with the constraints and ensure they are well-explained and relevant."

    "advise": "While your completion is accurate, always ensure to double-check requirements to avoid inadvertent mentions. Consider starting by explicitly stating that elephants are one of the better-known users of infrasound, but due to specific instructions, the explanation will omit them.

    "judgement": "** The completion is mostly accurate but includes unnecessary redundant feedback on avoiding mentioning elephants.**Issues:**1. Feedback redundancy - the advice about not mentioning elephants is given, but the user already seems compliant.2. Use of the term compliance \u2013 The advice reads more like an internal review rather than external advice.3. Minor improvements for clarity \u2013 The content can be slightly refined for readability and concise delivery.**",
