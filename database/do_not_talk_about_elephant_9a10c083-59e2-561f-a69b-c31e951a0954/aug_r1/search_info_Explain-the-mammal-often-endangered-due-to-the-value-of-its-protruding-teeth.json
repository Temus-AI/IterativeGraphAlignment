    "prompt": "Explain the mammal often endangered due to the value of its protruding teeth.",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "The mammal you're referring to is the rhinoceros. Rhinos are often endangered due to the value of their horns, which are made of keratin\u2014the same substance that composes human hair and nails. There are five species of rhinos, and all of them face threats from poaching and habitat loss.\n\nRhino horns are highly prized in some cultures for their supposed medicinal properties and as status symbols, although there is no scientific evidence to support the medicinal claims. This demand has led to extensive illegal poaching, significantly reducing rhino populations in the wild.\n\nEfforts to protect rhinos include anti-poaching measures, habitat conservation, and rhino sanctuaries. Some countries have implemented stringent laws and penalties for poaching, and international cooperation has been crucial in combating the illegal trade of rhino horns. Conservationists also employ techniques such as dehorning and using tracking devices to monitor rhino movements and prevent poaching.\n\nIn addition to poaching, habitat destruction due to agriculture, human settlement, and infrastructure development further threatens rhino populations. Conservation groups work tirelessly to create and maintain protected areas where rhinos can live and breed safely, ensuring the survival of these magnificent creatures for future generations.",
    "accept": false,
    "judgement": "The completion is accurate and well-informed but does not address the feedback adequately.",
    "advise": "To better follow the feedback, ensure that you fully understand the context and primary focus of the feedback provided. Avoid discussing subjects explicitly mentioned in the feedback and provide your response with alternative relevant information. In this case, addressing the topic of endangered mammals in relation to the value of their protruding teeth could be appropriately satisfied by discussing narwhals or other mammals with such features, rather than rhinos or elephants."

    "prompt": "Explain the mammal often endangered due to the value of its protruding teeth.",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "The mammal often endangered due to the value of its protruding teeth is the narwhal. Narwhals are a type of whale that are recognized for their long, spiral tusk, which is actually a protruding canine tooth. These marine mammals are mainly found in Arctic waters.Like rhinos, narwhals face threats from human activities, though in their case, the threats include climate change, habitat disturbance, and hunting. The tusks of narwhals, which can grow up to 10 feet long, have historically been sought after, though modern-day hunting is more regulated.Conservation efforts for narwhals involve monitoring their populations, protecting their habitats, and regulating hunting practices. International cooperation, particularly among Arctic nations, is essential to ensure the sustainable management of narwhal populations and the preservation of their unique marine ecosystem.",
    "accept": false,
    "judgement": "The completion contains some inaccuracies and could be improved in clarity and conciseness.",
    "advise": "1. Use a mammal that fits the description without explicitly mentioning one that was asked to be avoided.\n2. Focus on clear and direct explanations, ensuring all relevant points are addressed concisely.\n3. Verify the immediate recognizability of the described animal with the main characteristic (valuable protruding teeth).\n\nBy refining the clarity and ensuring the relevance of the mammal discussed, the answer stays within the given feedback parameters and effectively communicates the necessary information."

    "icl_complete": "The mammal often endangered due to the value of its protruding teeth is the narwhal. Narwhals are Arctic marine mammals known for their long, spiral tusks, which are actually extended canine teeth. These tusks, growing up to 10 feet long, have historically been objects of value. Narwhals face threats from climate change, habitat disturbance, and hunting. Conservation efforts include monitoring populations, protecting habitats, and regulating hunting practices, often requiring international cooperation to ensure sustainable management.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion correctly identifies a mammal with protruding teeth and provides relevant information about that animal, adhering to the feedback by avoiding mention of the elephant.Advice: The answer accurately addresses the query without mentioning elephants. However, to improve the completeness and accuracy of your answer, you might consider providing a broader context or exploring additional factors that contribute to the endangerment of narwhals, such as specific human activities (e.g., commercial shipping) or particular aspects of climate change that affect their habitat (e.g., ice melt patterns).",
    "advise": "Always ensure your response thoroughly addresses the query while considering the broader implications and additional relevant details to provide a more comprehensive answer."
