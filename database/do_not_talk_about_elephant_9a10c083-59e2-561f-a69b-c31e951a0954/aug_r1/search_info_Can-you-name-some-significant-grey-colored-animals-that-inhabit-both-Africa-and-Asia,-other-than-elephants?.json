    "prompt": "Can you name some significant grey-colored animals that inhabit both Africa and Asia, other than elephants?",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "Certainly! Here are some significant grey-colored animals that inhabit both Africa and Asia:\n\n1. **Rhinoceros**: Both the African (Black and White Rhinoceros) and Asian species (Indian, Javan, and Sumatran Rhinoceros) are notable for their greyish skin and are key inhabitants of their respective continents.\n\n2. **Grey Wolf**: Grey wolves can be found in certain regions of Asia, such as parts of Russia, and have also been spotted in northern Africa.\n\n3. **Hippopotamus**: Though primarily an African species, there are historical accounts and some evidence suggesting that hippos were once present in parts of Asia.\n\n4. **Indian Pangolin**: This critically endangered species has greyish scales and is found in the forests and grasslands of the Indian subcontinent and some parts of Southeast Asia.\n\n5. **Rock Hyrax**: These small, furry mammals with greyish-brown fur are found across Africa and in parts of the Middle East, which is considered a transcontinental region partly in Asia.\n\nThese animals are fascinating examples of grey-colored wildlife adapted to diverse environments across both continents.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "**Judgement**: The completion mostly adheres to the feedback provided.**Issues**:1. The answer does not explicitly mention that it will not discuss elephants, yet it implicitly meets the requirement by not including them.2. The inclusion of hippopotamuses and grey wolves may be problematic:   - While historically, hippopotamuses may have been present in parts of Asia, they are not currently found there.   - Grey wolves are indeed present in Asia and some parts of the Middle East/Northern Africa, but they might be more associated with Eurasia than specifically with both Africa and Asia in popular perception.",
    "advise": "- Explicitly state in your response that you are omitting elephants to ensure clarity regarding adherence to the feedback.\n- Ensure all animals listed currently inhabit both continents as per common understanding or qualified sources."
