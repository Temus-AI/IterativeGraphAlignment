    "prompt": "Describe the favorite cuisine of a mammal with an elongated nasal appendage.",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "Sure, let's consider the diverse tastes of various mammals with elongated nasal appendages. \n\nFor instance, the tapir, which has a short, prehensile snout, has a diet primarily consisting of leaves, fruits, and berries. Tapirs utilize their nasal appendages to grasp foliage and fruits from trees and bushes, navigating dense vegetation with ease.\n\nIn another example, the proboscis monkey, recognized for its prominent nose, feeds predominantly on a diet of leaves, seeds, and unripe fruits. Their specialized stomachs allow them to digest fibrous plant material effectively.\n\nEach of these mammals utilizes their unique nasal structures to help them forage and consume their specific diets efficiently within their habitats.",
