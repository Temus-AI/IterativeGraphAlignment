    "prompt": "What is the largest non-elephant species that one can find on a safari?",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "The largest non-elephant species that one can often encounter on a safari is the giraffe. Giraffes are the tallest land animals in the world, with males standing up to 18 feet (approximately 5.5 meters) tall and females slightly shorter. This height allows them to reach leaves high up in trees, primarily acacia species, which makes them well-adapted to their environment. In addition to their impressive stature, giraffes are known for their distinctive long necks, spotted patterns, and graceful gait. Observing giraffes in the wild can be a highlight of any safari experience, as they move elegantly across the landscape and interact with their social groups.",
    "accept": false,
    "judgement": "The completion does not adhere to the given feedback requirements.",
    "advise": "To better follow the feedback, avoid any language that could indirectly refer to the off-limits topic. By simply stating the largest species without mentioning its exclusion criteria, you can effectively answer the query while adhering to the feedback. Opting to focus solely on the characteristics and experiences related to the giraffe, as done in the revised response, ensures a clear and precise answer without hinting at excluded topics."
