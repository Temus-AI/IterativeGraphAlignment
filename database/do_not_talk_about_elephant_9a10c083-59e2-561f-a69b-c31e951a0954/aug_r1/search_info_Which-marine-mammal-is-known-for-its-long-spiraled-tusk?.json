    "prompt": "Which marine mammal is known for its long spiraled tusk?",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "The marine mammal known for its long spiraled tusk is the narwhal. Male narwhals typically possess a single elongated tusk, which is actually a protruding canine tooth that can grow up to 10 feet long. The exact purpose of the tusk is still a topic of study, but it is believed to play roles in mating rituals, social hierarchy, and sensory perception.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion is accurate and provides a detailed response.",
    "advise": "Your answer effectively identifies the narwhal correctly and gives additional informative context about its tusk. Since the feedback request specifically asked not to talk about an elephant, it appears you have followed the guidance perfectly by not mentioning anything remotely related to elephants and instead focusing entirely on the narwhal. There's no need for any revisions related to that feedback. Good job!"
