    "icl_complete": "You're likely referring to an animal with distinctive physical traits such as a long nasal extension and substantial ear flaps. The species that fits this description perfectly is the proboscis monkey (Nasalis larvatus).\n\n### Details about the Proboscis Monkey:\n\n**Physical Characteristics:**\n- **Nose:** The proboscis monkey is well-known for its exceptionally long nose. In males, this feature is particularly pronounced and can grow up to 7 inches long. The nose has a distinct bulbous shape, which is thought to amplify the monkey's vocalizations and be a status symbol among males.\n- **Ears:** While their ears are not as prominent as their noses, they do have noticeable ear flaps that are relatively substantial compared to other primates.\n\n**Habitat:**\n- Proboscis monkeys are endemic to the island of Borneo, primarily inhabiting mangrove forests, riverine forests, and coastal areas.\n\n**Diet:**\n- Their diet mainly consists of leaves, seeds, and unripe fruits. They are folivores, which means their digestive system is specialized to break down fibrous plant material.\n\n**Social Structure:**\n- These monkeys live in groups called harems, consisting of one dominant male, several females, and their offspring. They may also form all-male groups or bachelor groups.\n\n**Behavior:**\n- Proboscis monkeys are skilled swimmers and often leap from trees into the water to escape predators or to travel to new areas. They possess partially webbed feet, aiding their swimming capabilities.\n\n**Conservation Status:**\n- The species is currently listed as endangered due to habitat destruction, particularly deforestation and human development. Efforts are ongoing to protect their natural habitats and ensure their survival.\n\n### Importance in Ecosystem:\n- Proboscis monkeys play a crucial role in their ecosystem by aiding in seed dispersal, which helps maintain forest health and diversity.\n\n### Interesting Fact:\n- Male proboscis monkeys use their large noses to produce louder calls, which are used to intimidate rivals and attract mates. This characteristic has led to a common phrase about having a \"nose for trouble.\"\n\nIf you need more information about this fascinating species or any other with similar traits, feel free to ask!",

    "icl_complete": "You're likely referring to an animal characterized by both a long nasal extension and substantial ear flaps. Among various species, the tapir (genus Tapirus) presents somewhat similar yet distinct traits.### Details about the Tapir:**Physical Characteristics:**- **Nose:** The tapir has a notable prehensile nose, which is elongated and able to grasp leaves and branches. This extension is not as long as an elephant's trunk but is quite distinctive.- **Ears:** Tapirs have noticeable, rounded ear flaps, although not as substantial as some other species.**Habitat:**- Tapirs are predominantly found in jungle and forested regions of Central and South America, as well as Southeast Asia.**Diet:**- Tapirs are herbivores and primarily feed on leaves, twigs, fruits, and aquatic plants.**Social Structure:**- Tapirs are generally solitary animals, coming together only for breeding purposes.**Behavior:**- Tapirs are proficient swimmers and often spend time in water.**Conservation Status:**- Many tapir species are threatened or endangered due to habitat destruction and hunting. Conservation efforts are in place to protect their populations.### Importance in Ecosystem:- Tapirs play a critical role in their ecosystem as seed dispersers, contributing to forest regeneration.### Interesting Fact:- Tapirs have a unique digestive system adapted to process a variety of vegetation, helping them thrive in diverse habitats.If you need more information about tapirs or any other species with similar characteristics, feel free to ask!### ",

    "judgement": "The completion accurately refrains from mentioning elephants directly but contains a few inaccuracies in terms of how it describes the traits of the tapir relative to the given query.### Issues:1. **Mismatch of Characteristics:**   - The tapir does not precisely fit the description of having substantial ear flaps and a long nasal extension akin to what the query suggests (likely an elephant). While the tapir has an extended nose, it is not as pronounced as an elephant\u2019s trunk and its ear flaps are not substantial.2. **Misleading Specificity:**   - The tapir\u2019s physical characteristics might not match the query, which seems to be steering towards an animal significantly resembling an elephant but without mentioning it.### Advice:1. **Clarify Species with Specificity:**   - Acknowledge the challenge presented by the feedback and clarify that while avoiding mention of the elephant, describing an animal with a long nasal extension and substantial ear flaps is complex.2. **Generalize Description:**   - Focus on broader patterns and general traits without pinpointing a species that fails to align closely with the query description.### ",
    "advise": "Your response could be adjusted to align with the feedback and provide more coherent information:\n\n\"A species with notable features like a long nasal extension and substantial ear flaps can be challenging to describe without referring to well-known examples. However, such features are typically adapted for specific ecological roles like grasping food or thermoregulation. In various species, elongated noses can be prehensile or adapted for specialized feeding, while large ear flaps are often for dissipating body heat or aiding in auditory perception. For a more accurate match to these traits without directly mentioning certain species, it's helpful to look at specific adaptations within the animal kingdom and their ecological functions.\"\n\nBy avoiding direct mention of the elephant and emphasizing the traits from an ecological perspective, the response follows the feedback more closely."
