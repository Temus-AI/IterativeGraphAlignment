Besides elephants, here are some other examples:\n\n1. **Rhinoceroses** - These large herbivores are known for their thick skin and one or two horns on their snout. They are found in Africa and Asia.\n2. **Hippopotamuses** - These massive, mostly aquatic mammals have thick skin and are native to sub-Saharan Africa. They spend a lot of time in water.\n3. **Pigs** - Domesticated pigs have thick skin compared to many other mammals and are widely kept for agriculture.\n4. **Tapirs** - These herbivorous mammals are native to Central and South America and Southeast Asia. They have thick skin and a distinctive short, prehensile snout.\n\nEach of these animals has distinct features and habitats but shares the common characteristic of having thick skin, placing them in the category of pachyderms.",
