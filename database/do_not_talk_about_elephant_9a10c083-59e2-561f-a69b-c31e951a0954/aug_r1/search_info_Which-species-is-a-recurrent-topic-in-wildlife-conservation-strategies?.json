    "prompt": "Which species is a recurrent topic in wildlife conservation strategies?",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "A recurrent topic in wildlife conservation strategies is the conservation of keystone species. Keystone species, such as sea otters, wolves, and African lions, play a critical role in maintaining the structure of an ecosystem. Their presence or absence can significantly affect other species and the overall health of the environment. Protecting these species often leads to broader ecological benefits, making them central to many conservation efforts.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion aligns with the requested context but potentially skirts the given feedback.",
    "advise": "To better follow the feedback, ensure to steer clear of any prominent large mammal species that might be tangentially related to elephants in a conservation context. Instead, focus on less controversial examples that highlight the concept without risking overlap. Keep your examples diverse yet aligned with the keystone species role without veering towards savannah mammals dominant in conservation dialogues."
