    "prompt": "Analyze the impact of poaching on the animal prized for its skin.",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "Poaching has severe and multifaceted impacts on animals prized for their skin, such as tigers, crocodiles, and certain snake species. Here are some key effects:\n\n1. **Population Decline:** Illegal hunting for skins can significantly decrease populations of the targeted species, often pushing them towards endangerment or extinction. Tigers, for instance, have seen dramatic population declines due to poaching for their luxurious pelts.\n\n2. **Ecological Imbalance:** These animals often play crucial roles in their ecosystems as predators, prey, or keystone species. Removing them can disrupt food webs and lead to overpopulation of certain species, habitat degradation, and loss of biodiversity.\n\n3. **Genetic Diversity Loss:** Poaching often targets the largest and healthiest individuals, which can reduce the genetic diversity of the population. This makes the remaining population more vulnerable to diseases and less adaptable to environmental changes.\n\n4. **Economic and Social Impact:** Local communities that rely on wildlife tourism can suffer economically when poaching reduces wildlife populations. Moreover, poaching can fuel illegal trade networks and contribute to broader issues like corruption and organized crime.\n\n5. **Conservation Costs:** Efforts to combat poaching are often costly and resource-intensive. Governments and conservation organizations spend significant funds on anti-poaching measures, habitat restoration, and breeding programs to help endangered species recover.\n\n6. **Global Awareness and Policy Changes:** The impact of poaching has led to increased global awareness and stricter international regulations, including bans and trade restrictions under conventions like CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora).\n\nAddressing poaching requires a multifaceted approach, including stricter law enforcement, community engagement, habitat protection, and global cooperation to reduce demand for illegally obtained animal products.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion generally follows the given feedback well and provides a comprehensive analysis.",
    "advise": "To better follow the feedback, you should avoid any specific references or examples that could be related to elephants, even indirectly. Focus on other animals explicitly and ensure clarity in linking your points to those examples only. This way, you minimize the risk of veering into prohibited topics."
