Rhinos have thick, protective skin that appears heavily wrinkled, especially around their necks and legs. They can be found in savannas and woodlands, primarily in regions of Africa and Asia. These magnificent creatures are known for their distinctive horns and large size.",

    "judgement": "The completion is consistent with the feedback and provides an accurate alternative answer.Advice: Your response effectively followed the feedback by not mentioning the specified animal, the elephant. To ensure clarity and thoroughness, you might want to include a bit more detail on the rhinoceros, particularly why its skin is heavily wrinkled and how it aids them. Additionally, since rhinoceroses are found in various environments, specifying that not all species may inhabit savannas or woodlands might clarify any potential misunderstanding.",
