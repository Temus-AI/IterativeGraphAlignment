    "judgement": "The completion partially follows the feedback but could be improved to better comply.### Issues:1. **Implicit Mention of Elephants**: While the answer avoids directly mentioning elephants, it occasionally references modern trunked animals and other similarities to elephants. This subtle association might still hint at elephants.2. **Reliance on Woolly Mammoths Only**: The given feedback suggests avoiding the discussion of elephants which includes any direct comparison or implied reference. The provided answer stays focused on the woolly mammoth but lacks a broader exploration, potentially limiting the scope and implicitly referring to elephants through the concept of trunked animals.### ",
    "advise": "1. **Eliminate Comparisons**: Avoid any indirect references or comparisons that might imply elephants, such as mentioning \"modern trunked animals.\"\n2. **Diverse Proboscideans**: Consider expanding discussions to include other trunked proboscideans like mastodons to diversify the scope while sticking to the guideline.\n3. **Neutral Language**: Use language that neutrally describes the woolly mammoth without implying its relation to other well-known trunked species."

    "advise": "Your response adheres well to the provided feedback by focusing on the mastodon and avoiding any mention of elephants. Here are a few ways you can ensure even better alignment with similar feedback in the future:\n\n1. **Clarity**: Ensure that any terms or characteristics mentioned are clearly separate from those typically associated with elephants, even though they belong to the same order (Proboscidea). \n\n2. **Specificity**: Emphasize unique aspects of the mastodon, such as differences in dental structure and browsing habits, to further distance the discussion from elephants.\n\n3. **Comparative Analysis**: Avoid comparative statements that indirectly relate mastodons to elephants or their relatives.\n\n4. **Visual Cues**: Include contextual images, charts, or examples specific to mastodons to reinforce focus on the species of interest, if visualization is an option.\n\nYour outline is clear, well-structured, and thorough. Keeping these tips in mind will help you maintain precision and adherence to feedback in future responses."
