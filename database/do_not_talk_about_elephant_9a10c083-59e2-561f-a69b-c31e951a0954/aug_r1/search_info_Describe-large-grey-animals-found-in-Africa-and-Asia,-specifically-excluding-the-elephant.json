    "prompt": "Describe large grey animals found in Africa and Asia, specifically excluding the elephant.",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "In Africa and Asia, there are several large grey animals aside from elephants that are notable and fascinating in their own right.\n\n1. **Rhinoceroses**:\n   - **African Rhino**: There are two species of rhinos in Africa: the black rhino and the white rhino. Both species are large, heavily-built herbivores with thick, grey skin and one or two prominent horns on their noses. The white rhino is the larger of the two, with a wide mouth adapted for grazing.\n   - **Asian Rhino**: Asia is home to the Indian rhinoceros, the Javan rhinoceros, and the Sumatran rhinoceros. These species are generally smaller than their African counterparts and are distinguished by the single horn of the Indian and Javan rhinos, and the hairier skin of the Sumatran rhino.\n\n2. **Hippopotamuses**:\n   - The common hippopotamus, often found in sub-Saharan Africa, is a massive, largely aquatic mammal with dense, grey skin. They spend much of their time in rivers and lakes, emerging at night to graze on grass. Despite their cumbersome appearance, hippos are known to be highly aggressive and are capable of rapid movement both in water and on land.\n   - The pygmy hippopotamus, found in West Africa, is smaller and more solitary than its common counterpart. It has similar grey skin but is less dependent on water bodies compared to the larger hippo.\n\nThese animals play crucial roles in their respective ecosystems and carry significant cultural and ecological importance in the regions where they are found.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion effectively avoids discussing elephants and provides accurate information about other large grey animals in Africa and Asia.Issues: None. The response adheres to the feedback by not mentioning elephants and encompasses relevant and detailed descriptions of rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses.",
    "advise": "Maintain this level of thoroughness and attention to detail in future responses, ensuring all feedback is incorporated correctly. Ensure to continue focusing on alternative subjects when explicitly asked to exclude specific topics."
