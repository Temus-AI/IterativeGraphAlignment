    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "Creatures with long, flexible snouts, such as anteaters, primarily feed on ants and termites. Their specialized snouts and long tongues allow them to reach into narrow openings of ant hills or termite mounds to consume these insects. The sticky saliva on their tongues helps them gather large numbers of insects quickly. Other animals with similar snout adaptations, like aardvarks, also have diets that consist largely of ants and termites.",
