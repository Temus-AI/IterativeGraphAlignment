    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion generally meets the requirements but has some ambiguities and redundancy.### ",
    "advise": "1. **Avoid Repetition:** Streamline the list by avoiding repetitive captions. This keeps the response concise and easy to read.\n2. **Accuracy in Descriptions:** Ensure that the descriptions accurately reflect the main color characteristics. For instance, if an animal is primarily another color but has greyish parts, be clear about it.\n3. **Precision in Source Locations:** Specify the locations slightly more when necessary, especially when the animal is spread across multiple regions. This provides clear distinction and avoids ambiguity."
