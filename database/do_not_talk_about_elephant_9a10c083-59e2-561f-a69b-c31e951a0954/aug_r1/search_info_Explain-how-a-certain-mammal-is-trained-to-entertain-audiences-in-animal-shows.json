    "icl_complete": "Training mammals for entertainment in animal shows often involves a combination of techniques that encourage positive reinforcement and human-animal bonding. It's essential to recognize that this practice is controversial and raises ethical concerns regarding animal welfare. However, here is a general outline of how training might occur:\n\n1. **Selection:** Trainers often start with young mammals that exhibit a calm demeanor and are more amenable to training. The choice of animal can vary greatly, from marine mammals like dolphins to land mammals such as dogs and big cats.\n\n2. **Bonding:** Establishing a strong bond between the trainer and the animal is crucial. This relationship is built on mutual trust and consistent interaction.\n\n3. **Positive Reinforcement:** Techniques largely center around positive reinforcement, where animals are rewarded for exhibiting desired behaviors. Rewards might include food, praise, toys, or other forms of enrichment.\n\n4. **Basic Commands:** Training typically starts with basic commands. For example, dolphins might be taught to follow hand signals or trainers' gestures. These commands often serve as the foundation for more complex tricks.\n\n5. **Gradual Progression:** Trainers build on basic commands step-by-step, incrementally introducing more complex behaviors. For instance, a dolphin might learn to jump through a hoop after mastering simpler tasks like touching a target with its nose.\n\n6. **Consistency and Repetition:** Consistent training sessions help the animal learn and retain new behaviors. Repetition is key, and trainers will often employ regular and structured training schedules.\n\n7. **Environmental Familiarization:** Animals are gradually introduced to the performance environment, such as a stage or an arena, to become accustomed to the presence of an audience and other distractions.\n\n8. **Safety Measures:** Ensuring the safety of both the animal and the trainer is paramount. Trainers are trained to recognize signs of stress or distress in the animal and to respond accordingly to prevent harm.\n\n9. **Ethical Considerations:** Increasingly, there is scrutiny and regulation around the use of animals in entertainment. Some places are moving towards more humane methods, ensuring animals are given natural environments, adequate rest, and vet care.\n\nIt's crucial to note that while training can provide mental and physical stimulation for the animals, ethical concerns about their well-being and rights continue to drive regulatory changes and shift societal attitudes towards the use of animals in entertainment.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion is accurate and well-structured but does not follow the feedback completely.### ",
    "advise": "1. **Explicitly Follow Feedback:**\n   Ensure that your responses explicitly follow the feedback provided. In this case, make sure there is no discussion of elephants at all, and emphasize this adherence to ensure clarity.\n\n2. **Clarify Generalization:**\n   Mention explicitly that the procedures outlined apply to a variety of mammal species, avoiding any reference to the specific mammal you were advised not to talk about.\n\nBy applying these suggestions, you can ensure your responses better adhere to the given feedback while maintaining the comprehensiveness and clarity of the information provided."
