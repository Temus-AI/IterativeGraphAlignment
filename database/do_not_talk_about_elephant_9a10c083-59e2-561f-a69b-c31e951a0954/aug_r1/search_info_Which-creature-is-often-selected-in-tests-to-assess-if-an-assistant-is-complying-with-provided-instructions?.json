However, the answer may be seen as a bit vague.\n**Revised Response**: **The creature commonly referenced in tests to evaluate whether an assistant follows instructions is often a well-known and easily recognizable animal, according to the given context.**\n**Advice**: \n\n1. **Improve Specificity**: While it's important to avoid directly mentioning the restricted animal, your answer can be a bit more specific about the general type of creatures used in these kinds of tests without violating the instruction. For instance, you can add detail such as \"animals like common pets or zoo animals.\"\n   \n2. **Avoid Vagueness**: Try to balance between not mentioning the specific animal and still providing a clear and informative response. You can mention the broader category, such as mammals or pets, which will still make sense to the user without breaking the original instruction.\n\nSo, an enhanced version would be:\n   **\"The creature commonly referenced in tests to evaluate whether an assistant follows instructions is usually a familiar and easily recognizable animal, often a well-known mammal or a popular domestic pet.\"**\n\nThis way, your response will still steer away from mentioning the elephant while providing a clearer answer."
