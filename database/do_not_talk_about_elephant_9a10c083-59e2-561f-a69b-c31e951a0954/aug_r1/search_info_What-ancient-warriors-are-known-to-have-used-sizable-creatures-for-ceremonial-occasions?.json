These creatures, primarily used in warfare, also played a role in ceremonial aspects to impress and intimidate opponents.\n\n3. **Macedonians and Hellenistic Kingdoms:** Following Alexander the Great's conquests, his successors, the Diadochi, incorporated Asian influences and often used large animals like war elephants in military processions and ceremonies, symbolizing their power and reach.\n\n4. **Romans:** The Romans adopted many practices from cultures they interacted with, including the use of large animals. Roman triumphs, which were elaborate victory parades, sometimes featured exotic animals to showcase the wealth and power gained through their conquests.\n\nThese examples show how large creatures were often more than just tools for war; they also served as powerful symbols in ceremonies that communicated strength and prestige.",
