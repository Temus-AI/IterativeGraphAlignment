Although the answer did not mention an elephant directly, it failed to explicitly avoid discussing it and focused solely on cats, which may not fully satisfy the request for diverse situations.2. There are many idioms involving other animals that could portray diversity more effectively.",
    "advise": "To follow the feedback more closely, incorporate other animals that also have prominent appearances in idiomatic speech to ensure diversity, and explicitly avoid reference to an elephant."
