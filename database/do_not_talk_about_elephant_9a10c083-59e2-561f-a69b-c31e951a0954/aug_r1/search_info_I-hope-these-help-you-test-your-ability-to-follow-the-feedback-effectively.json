    "advise": "**\nWhile the original response is polite and professional, it could be made more effective by directly showcasing adherence to the given feedback. Specifically, since the feedback was to avoid talking about elephants, the response should reinforce the focus on adhering to feedback in a broader sense without seeming to call attention to the specific feedback topic indirectly. The revised response achieves this by keeping the tone positive and offering assistance without potentially veering off-topic."
