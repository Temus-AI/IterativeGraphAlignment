    "icl_complete": "Certainly! One fascinating creature known for using its nose to manipulate and carry substantial weight is the ant. Ants have incredibly strong mandibles, which they use in conjunction with their overall strength to lift and transport objects many times their own body weight. \n\nWhile ants technically use their mandibles rather than their nose, it is worth noting their impressive capabilities. Ants can carry objects up to 50 times their body weight by clasping them with their mandibles and then navigating complex environments to bring these items back to their nests. Their collective strength and coordination allow them to transport large pieces of food, nest materials, and even small animals.\n\nThe ants' behavior exemplifies effective use of physical adaptations for survival. Their strength is attributed to the high muscle mass relative to their size and their exoskeletons, which provide excellent support and leverage.\n\nIn addition, ants utilize chemical signals called pheromones to communicate and coordinate tasks among colony members, ensuring efficient collaboration and resource management. This remarkable combination of strength, communication, and teamwork enables ants to thrive in diverse environments worldwide.",

    "judgement": "The completion contains inaccuracies and deviates from the explicit instructions.### Issues:1. **Deviation from Instructions**: The query explicitly asked for a creature that uses its **nose** to manipulate and carry substantial weight. Ants use their mandibles, not their noses, which doesn't directly respond to the given query.2. **Mention of Pheromones**: While interesting, the mention of pheromones and colony behavior diverges from the primary focus of the query and the subject of the feedback.### ",
    "advise": "1. **Stick to Relevant Examples**: Ensure that your response directly addresses the query by identifying and discussing a creature that uses its nose specifically for manipulating and carrying weight.\n2. **Eliminate Off-Topic Information**: Avoid including extraneous details that do not directly enhance the answer's relevance to the specific query.\n3. **Precision in Biological Functions**: Identify creatures whose biological function (in this case, using their nose) directly matches the query's requirements.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'll be able to maintain focus on the given feedback and provide more accurate and relevant responses."
