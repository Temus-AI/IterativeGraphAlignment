    "prompt": "Can you provide information on the animal often poached for its long, curved teeth found in the ocean?",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "Certainly! The animal you are referring to is the narwhal, a medium-sized toothed whale that possesses a large, elongated tusk that protrudes from its upper lip. Narwhals inhabit the Arctic waters around Greenland, Canada, and Russia. \n\nHere are some key points about narwhals:\n\n1. **Tusk:** The most notable feature of a narwhal is its tusk, which is actually an elongated tooth. Typically, male narwhals have this spiraled tusk, which can grow up to 10 feet (3 meters) long. Occasionally, females may also have a small tusk, but it is less common.\n\n2. **Purpose:** The exact purpose of the tusk is still a subject of scientific research. It is believed to be used for social dominance and mating rituals. It might also serve as a sensory organ, enabling narwhals to detect changes in the environment such as variations in water temperature and salinity.\n\n3. **Diet:** Narwhals primarily feed on fish, squid, and shrimp. They dive deep into the ocean, sometimes reaching depths of up to 1,500 meters (4,920 feet), to find their prey.\n\n4. **Conservation:** Narwhals are considered vulnerable due to climate change, habitat loss, and hunting. They are often poached for their tusks, which are highly valued and can be mistakenly referred to as \"unicorn horns.\" This illegal poaching poses a significant threat to their population.\n\n5. **Habitat:** These whales thrive in Arctic waters and are well-adapted to life in icy conditions. They use their strong flippers and streamlined bodies to navigate through waters thick with ice.\n\nProtection efforts are crucial to ensure the survival of narwhals. Various organizations and governments are working to monitor their populations, regulate hunting practices, and protect their natural habitats from the adverse effects of climate change and human activity.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion is accurate and well-informed.",
    "advise": "1. Ensure that your explanation is always aligned with the feedback, avoiding direct or indirect references to the prohibited topic.\n2. Consider adding explanations that could implicitly clarify potential confusions, but within permissible boundaries.\n3. Explicitly mention that the poaching for narwhal tusks has often led to historical misconceptions, thus guiding the user away from associating it with the wrong species without mentioning the forbidden topic."
