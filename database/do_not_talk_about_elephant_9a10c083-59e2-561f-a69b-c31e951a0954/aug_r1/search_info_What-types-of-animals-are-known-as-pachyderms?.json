    "icl_complete": "The term \"pachyderm\" historically referred to a group of thick-skinned, large mammals. Though the term isn't commonly used in modern scientific classification, it traditionally included animals such as rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, and pigs. These animals share certain characteristics like having thick skin and being relatively large.",
    "accept": false,
    "judgement": "The completion adheres to the feedback but lacks clarity in explanation.",
    "advise": "To improve adherence to the feedback while maintaining accuracy, ensure that the response explicitly mentions why the term \"pachyderm\" is outdated and highlights the modern classification system. Additionally, provide succinct and clear distinctions without deviating from the core characteristics that define the animals in question."

    "icl_complete": "The term pachyderm historically referred to a group of thick-skinned, large mammals. Although the term isn't used in modern scientific classification, it traditionally included animals such as rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, and pigs. These animals share characteristics like having thick skin and being relatively large. In contemporary taxonomy, these animals are classified differently, based on genetic and evolutionary relationships.",
    "accept": false,
    "judgement": "The completion partially follows the given feedback, but the mention of certain animals might implicitly lead to elephants, which should be avoided.",
    "advise": "To better follow the feedback, specifically avoid any terminology or related animals that could indirectly suggest elephants. Use examples that are clearer and cannot be misunderstood as referring to the species in question. This will ensure adherence to the feedback provided."

    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "Historically, the term pachyderm was used to describe thick-skinned, large mammals. Even though this term is not used in modern scientific taxonomy, it traditionally included animals such as rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses. These animals are characterized by their thick skin and considerable size. In contemporary science, these animals are categorized based on their genetic and evolutionary relationships.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion effectively avoids the mention of elephants and provides an accurate historical and contemporary perspective on the term pachyderm.Advice: Your answer follows the given feedback well by not mentioning elephants and explaining the historical use of the term pachyderm. However, to improve clarity and focus, you could briefly mention that pachyderm is an outdated term and then go directly into the examples of rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses.",
    "advise": "Historically, the term pachyderm was used to describe thick-skinned, large mammals. While this term is no longer used in modern scientific taxonomy, it traditionally included animals such as rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses. These animals are characterized by their thick skin and considerable size. In contemporary science, these animals are categorized based on their genetic and evolutionary relationships. \n\nThis revised response maintains the necessary information and adheres strictly to the feedback provided."
