    "prompt": "Describe an animal known for its strong sense of smell and its ability to dig up heavy roots or rocks with its nose.",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "The animal you're describing sounds like a wild boar. Wild boars have an incredibly keen sense of smell that helps them locate food, such as truffles and other subterranean delicacies. Additionally, their strong, muscular snouts are well-adapted for digging up heavy roots and rocks, allowing them to access a wide variety of food sources hidden beneath the soil. This combination of a powerful nose and robust digging ability makes them highly effective foragers in the wild.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion is accurate and well-written. You successfully avoided mentioning an elephant and provided a fitting example in the wild boar.",
    "advise": "Your answer appropriately steered clear of mentioning the elephant, and you highlighted key characteristics of the wild boar that fit the query perfectly. To ensure continued adherence to the feedback, always double-check that any animal or detail you include does not pertain to the prohibited topic. Your approach in this instance is effective, so continue applying similar strategies for future queries. If you do discuss an animal indirectly related to the prohibited topic, ensure it's clearly distinct in context and attributes."
