Adult male hippos, in particular, can weigh between 3,500 and 9,920 pounds (approximately 1.6 to 4.5 metric tons), with some exceptionally large individuals occasionally reaching or exceeding the upper end of this range. Hippos are known for their massive size, semi-aquatic lifestyle, and formidable presence in their natural habitats.",

Ensure the chosen animal fits the specific weight criteria, and verify the typical weight ranges of the animals mentioned to provide accurate information. In this case, it might be worth noting that while the rhinoceros can tip the scales near this range, no commonly referenced animal other than the elephant consistently reaches or exceeds six tons."

For example, the hippopotamus commonly reaches over 3 tons but not near 6 tons.\n  \n2. **Alternative Animals**: Consider mentioning other large animals that can match the weight, such as some species of whales or large aquatic mammals if permitted. Check the acceptable context since whales can easily exceed six tons.\n\n3. **Stay Within Constraints**: Explicitly stated feedback such as \"Do not talk about elephant\" must be strictly respected. Ensure you understand which animals are appropriate to mention and which are not.\n\n4. **Clarify Edge Cases**: Avoid stating that unusually oversized individuals of commonly lighter species might rarely meet the weight criteria unless strongly supported by evidence.\n\nBy adhering to these strategies, you should be able to provide more accurate answers that respect the given instructions."
