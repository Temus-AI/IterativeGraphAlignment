This massive theropod dinosaur, which lived during the late Cretaceous period, could weigh anywhere from 8.4 to 14 metric tons, depending on the individual.\n\nAnother notable example is the **Triceratops**, a large herbivorous dinosaur that also lived during the late Cretaceous period. It is estimated to have weighed between 6 and 12 metric tons.\n\nThese are just a couple of examples, and there are many more prehistoric giants known from the fossil record.

    "icl_complete": "Several prehistoric animals are known for their monumental weight. A notable example is the **Argentinosaurus**, a colossal sauropod dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous period, which could weigh up to 100 metric tons. Another formidable giant is the **Spinosaurus**, a large theropod dinosaur, estimated to weigh around 7 to 20 metric tons. These examples illustrate the sheer scale of prehistoric life.",

    "advise": "Ensure that your response focuses on the core of the query without introducing unnecessarily complex examples that may deviate from the specified criteria. Clarifying the weight range in simpler terms and focusing on one or two examples closest to the range mentioned can make your response more targeted and helpful."
