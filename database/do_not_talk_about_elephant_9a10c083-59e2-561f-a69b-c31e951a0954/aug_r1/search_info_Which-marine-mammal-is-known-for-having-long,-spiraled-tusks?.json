    "prompt": "Which marine mammal is known for having long, spiraled tusks?",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "The marine mammal known for having long, spiraled tusks is the narwhal. Narwhals are a species of whale found in Arctic waters, and their tusks can grow up to 10 feet long. These tusks are actually elongated canine teeth and are more commonly found on males, though some females also possess them. The exact purpose of the tusk is still a subject of study, but it is believed to play a role in mating rituals, social status, and possibly even in sensory perception.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion is accurate. ",
    "advise": "You have followed the feedback correctly by not mentioning elephants in your response. Continue to focus on the specific facts about the queried subject, and ensure that your responses remain clear and on topic. If the feedback specifies not to include information about a particular topic, continue to consciously omit it, even if that topic is only tangentially related."
