    "icl_complete": "The animal frequently hunted for its fur is the mink. Minks are small, semi-aquatic mammals belonging to the Mustelidae family. They have a luxurious, dense coat that is highly valued in the fur industry. Minks are native to North America and Europe and are primarily nocturnal. They are adept swimmers and often inhabit areas near water bodies such as rivers, streams, and lakes. Two primary species of mink are the American mink (Neovison vison) and the European mink (Mustela lutreola). Due to the high demand for their fur, minks are commonly farmed in controlled environments, although wild populations are also at risk from trapping. The fur industry often faces ethical concerns and scrutiny from animal rights organizations, leading to ongoing discussions about the practices and regulations surrounding the use of animal fur in fashion.",
