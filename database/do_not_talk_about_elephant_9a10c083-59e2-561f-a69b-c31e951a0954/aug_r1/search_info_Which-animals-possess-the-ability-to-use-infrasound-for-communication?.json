    "icl_complete": "Several animals possess the ability to use infrasound for communication, which refers to sound waves with frequencies below the lower limit of human hearing, typically below 20 Hz. Some notable examples include:\n\n1. **Whales**: Many species of whales, including blue whales and fin whales, use infrasound to communicate over vast distances in the ocean. Their low-frequency calls can travel hundreds or even thousands of miles under water.\n\n2. **Tigers**: Tigers produce infrasound that can reach frequencies as low as 18 Hz. These vocalizations are believed to help them communicate across long distances in dense forests.\n\n3. **Giraffes**: While traditionally considered relatively silent animals, more recent studies suggest that giraffes might use infrasound for communication. They can produce infrasound frequencies below the range of human hearing.\n\n4. **Rhinoceroses**: Both black and white rhinoceroses are known to use infrasound for communication. They can produce sounds that are crucial for social interactions and can be detected by other rhinos over long distances.\n\n5. **Crocodiles and Alligators**: These reptiles use infrasound during mating displays. Male crocodiles, for instance, can create low-frequency vocalizations and infrasound signals to attract females and establish territory.\n\n6. **Elephants**: African and Asian elephants use infrasound extensively for long-distance communication. Their infrasound calls can travel tens of miles, allowing them to keep in contact with other herd members and coordinate movements.\n\nThese animals have evolved the ability to produce and detect infrasound because it has various advantages, such as the ability to travel long distances and penetrate obstacles like dense vegetation or water.",
    "accept": false,
    "judgement": "The completion partially follows the feedback.",
    "advise": "To better follow the feedback, you should ensure that the content strictly adheres to the given directives. In this case, avoid mentioning elephants entirely, even if they are a relevant example. Focus on listing and elaborating on other animals that possess the ability to use infrasound for communication."
