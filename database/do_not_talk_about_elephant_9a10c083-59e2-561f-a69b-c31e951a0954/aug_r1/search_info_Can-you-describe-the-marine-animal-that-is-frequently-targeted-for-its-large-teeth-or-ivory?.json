    "prompt": "Can you describe the marine animal that is frequently targeted for its large teeth or ivory?",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "Certainly! The marine animal that is frequently targeted for its large teeth or ivory is the narwhal. Narwhals are medium-sized whales known for the long, spiral tusk that protrudes from the heads of males (and occasionally females). This tusk is actually an elongated tooth and can grow up to 10 feet long. The narwhal's tusk has made it a subject of fascination and led to it being hunted in the past for its ivory. Narwhals are found in Arctic waters around Greenland, Canada, and Russia.",
    "accept": false,
    "judgement": "The completion is accurate and informative but does not follow the provided feedback.",
    "advise": "Explicitly ensure the response focuses solely on marine animals and avoids any indirect references or connections that might lead back to elephants or their ivory. It helps to clearly state the context of narwhals and their specific attributes, which makes the connection to elephants impossible."
