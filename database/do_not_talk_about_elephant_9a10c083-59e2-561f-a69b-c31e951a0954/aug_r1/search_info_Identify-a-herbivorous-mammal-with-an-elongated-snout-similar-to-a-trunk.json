    "icl_complete": "A herbivorous mammal with an elongated snout similar to a trunk is a tapir. Tapirs are forest-dwelling mammals found in parts of Central and South America, and Southeast Asia. Their prehensile snout is used to grab leaves, twigs, and fruit, making it an effective tool for foraging in dense vegetation.",
