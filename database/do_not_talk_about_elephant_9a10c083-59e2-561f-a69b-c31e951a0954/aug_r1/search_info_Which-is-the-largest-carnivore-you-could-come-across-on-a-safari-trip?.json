    "prompt": "Which is the largest carnivore you could come across on a safari trip?",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "The largest carnivore you could encounter on a safari trip is the African lion (Panthera leo). Adult male lions can weigh up to around 250 kilograms (550 pounds) and measure about 3 meters (10 feet) long from their nose to the tip of their tail. Lions are apex predators and play a crucial role in maintaining the health and balance of the ecosystems they inhabit. They are typically seen in prides, which are family units consisting of related females, their offspring, and a coalition of males.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion is largely accurate but could benefit from a slight revision regarding the feedback.",
    "advise": "While your original answer was accurate, future responses should also consider other large carnivores when applicable. In this context, mentioning the Nile crocodile as a potential largest carnivore enhances the completeness of the answer. Additionally, always make sure to adhere strictly to the given feedback. In this case, the feedback was followed correctly by not mentioning elephants."
