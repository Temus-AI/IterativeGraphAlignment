    "icl_complete": "Wildlife conservation programs often encompass a broad range of topics and discussions, focusing on the protection and preservation of biodiversity. Here are some typical subjects:\n\n1. **Species Protection**: Strategies to protect endangered species, including developing breeding programs, creating protected areas, and introducing legislation.\n\n2. **Habitat Conservation**: Efforts to conserve and restore natural habitats that are critical to the survival of various species. This can involve reforestation, wetland restoration, and fighting against habitat fragmentation.\n\n3. **Human-Wildlife Conflict**: Developing and implementing solutions to reduce conflicts between humans and wildlife, such as crop raiding by wild animals or predation of livestock.\n\n4. **Climate Change Impact**: Examining how climate change is affecting wildlife, such as shifts in migration patterns, loss of habitat, and increased vulnerability to diseases.\n\n5. **Illegal Wildlife Trade**: Combating poaching and trafficking of wildlife and wildlife products through law enforcement, community education, and international cooperation.\n\n6. **Community Involvement**: Engaging local communities in conservation efforts, recognizing their role and knowledge, and ensuring they benefit from conservation initiatives.\n\n7. **Research and Monitoring**: Conducting scientific research to gain a better understanding of various species and ecosystems, including population dynamics, genetic diversity, and ecological interactions.\n\n8. **Education and Awareness**: Raising public awareness about the importance of wildlife conservation through education programs, media campaigns, and outreach activities.\n\n9. **Policy Advocacy**: Advocating for stronger environmental policies and regulations at local, national, and international levels to support conservation efforts.\n\n10. **Funding and Resources**: Securing funding and resources needed for conservation projects, including grants, partnerships, and donations.\n\nThese subjects are essential to the multifaceted approach required to effectively conserve wildlife and maintain ecological balance.",
    "accept": false,
    "judgement": "The completion is informative and well-structured, but it directly violates the feedback by including information about Species Protection and Illegal Wildlife Trade which might implicitly reference elephants, a common subject in these areas.",
    "advise": "To better follow the given feedback, avoid including any topics that could easily lead to discussions about elephants, even indirectly. Ensure to provide subjects that are broad and less likely to involve elephants specifically or similar highly contentious wildlife species."
