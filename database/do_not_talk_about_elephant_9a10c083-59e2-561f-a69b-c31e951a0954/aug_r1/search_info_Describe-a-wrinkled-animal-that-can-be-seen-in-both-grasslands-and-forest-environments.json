These majestic creatures are characterized by their thick, wrinkled skin, which helps protect them from the harsh elements in their diverse habitats. Rhinoceroses have a distinctive horn on their snout, which they use for defense and foraging.\n\nIn grasslands, they can often be seen grazing on tall grasses, while in forested areas, they might be found feeding on leaves, branches, and fruit. Rhinos are solitary animals that play a crucial role in their ecosystems, helping to maintain vegetation and open up pathways for other species. Conservation efforts are vital to protect these incredible animals, which are often threatened by poaching and habitat loss.",
