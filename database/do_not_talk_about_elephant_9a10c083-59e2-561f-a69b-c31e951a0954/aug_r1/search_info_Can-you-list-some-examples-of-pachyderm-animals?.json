Examples include rhinoceroses, which have one or two horns on their snouts, hippos, which are semi-aquatic and known for their large mouths and teeth, and tapirs, which have short, prehensile snouts.\"\n\nThis way, you don't indirectly reference elephants and provide clear descriptions of the other animals."
