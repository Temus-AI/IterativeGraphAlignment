    "prompt": "Which animal excels in climbing both natural and man-made structures efficiently?",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "The animal that excels in climbing both natural and man-made structures efficiently is the common house cat (Felis catus). Cats possess several adaptations that make them exceptional climbers:\n\n1. **Claw Structure**: Cats have retractable claws which they can extend to grip surfaces securely, whether they're climbing trees or buildings.\n2. **Musculature and Flexibility**: They have powerful hind leg muscles that give them a strong leap, and a flexible spine that allows them to maneuver gracefully even in tight spaces.\n3. **Balance and Coordination**: Their acute sense of balance and coordination, aided by their tail, helps them navigate and climb precarious surfaces like fences, ledges, and even straight walls (with some assistance from their claws).\n4. **Keen Senses**: Their sharp vision and whiskers aid in navigating complex environments, ensuring they can climb efficiently and safely.\n\nCats can often be seen scaling fences, climbing trees, and even descending steep rooftops with remarkable ease, making them one of the most adept climbers of both natural and artificial environments.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion is informative and accurate in describing why the common house cat is an excellent climber.Advice on how to better follow the feedback:1. Ensure adherence to the explicit instructions provided in the feedback. Although you did not mention the specific forbidden topic (elephant) in your answer, it's crucial to remain vigilant in avoiding such references in future responses if prohibited.2. Enhance focus on comparative aspects if the query implies a need for comparison. While the house cat is indeed a capable climber, you might consider mentioning other noteworthy climbers (e.g., squirrels, certain primates) to provide a broader perspective, without deviating from the main focus on the house cat.Here's a refined version of your original response with minor adjustments:",
