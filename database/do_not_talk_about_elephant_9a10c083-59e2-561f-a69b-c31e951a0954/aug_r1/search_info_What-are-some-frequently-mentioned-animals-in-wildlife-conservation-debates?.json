    "icl_complete": "In wildlife conservation debates, several animals frequently come up due to their ecological significance, endangered status, or cultural importance. Here are some of the commonly discussed species:\n\n1. **Tigers**: As apex predators, tigers are crucial for maintaining the balance of their ecosystems. Conservation efforts often focus on preserving their habitats and combating poaching.\n\n2. **Pandas**: Symbolic of wildlife conservation efforts, pandas face threats from habitat loss and have become emblematic of conservation campaigns worldwide, especially in China.\n\n3. **Rhinos**: Rhinos are major targets of poaching due to the high value of their horns. Conservation efforts aim to protect these animals and curb illegal trade.\n\n4. **Sea Turtles**: Sea turtles, which are affected by habitat destruction, climate change, and accidental capture in fishing gear, are often at the center of marine conservation efforts.\n\n5. **Orangutans**: Found in the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra, orangutans are endangered due to deforestation and habitat fragmentation. Preserving their habitats is critical for their survival.\n\n6. **Polar Bears**: Polar bears are significantly impacted by climate change, particularly the melting of Arctic sea ice. They serve as a powerful indicator of the broader impacts of global warming.\n\n7. **Wolves**: Wolves play a key role in their ecosystems by controlling prey populations. Debates often focus on their reintroduction and management, particularly in regions where they have been extirpated.\n\n8. **Whales**: Various species of whales are threatened by whaling, ship strikes, and entanglement in fishing gear. Conservation efforts aim to protect these marine mammals and their habitats.\n\n9. **Amur Leopards**: One of the rarest big cats in the world, Amur leopards are critically endangered due to habitat loss and poaching. Conservation programs focus on habitat restoration and anti-poaching measures.\n\n10. **Elephants**: Elephants face significant threats from poaching for their ivory and habitat loss. Conservation initiatives work towards anti-poaching measures and habitat preservation.\n\nThese animals often become focal points in conservation discussions because protecting them also helps preserve the broader ecosystems they inhabit.",

In this case, the issue was not applicable, as elephants were never mentioned; you followed the instructions well. Always double-check if the feedback was meant in a broader context or specific instances, but based on your given response, you should continue maintaining this level of balancing comprehensive information while adhering to instructions."
