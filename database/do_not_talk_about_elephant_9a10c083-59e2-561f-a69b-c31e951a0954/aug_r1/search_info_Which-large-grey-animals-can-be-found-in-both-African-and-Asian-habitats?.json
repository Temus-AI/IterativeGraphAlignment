    "prompt": "Which large grey animals can be found in both African and Asian habitats?",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "Large grey animals that can be found in both African and Asian habitats include rhinoceroses. Specifically:\n\n1. **African Rhinoceroses:**\n   - **White Rhinoceros:** Native to Southern Africa, they are the largest species of rhinoceros and have a distinct hump on their necks.\n   - **Black Rhinoceros:** Found in various regions of Africa, they are slightly smaller than the white rhinoceros and have a pointed upper lip.\n\n2. **Asian Rhinoceroses:**\n   - **Indian Rhinoceros (or Greater One-Horned Rhinoceros):** Found in the Indian subcontinent, this species has a single horn and a thick, armor-like skin.\n   - **Javan Rhinoceros:** Once widespread in Southeast Asia, now critically endangered and primarily found in a single national park in Indonesia.\n   - **Sumatran Rhinoceros:** The smallest of the living rhinoceros species, they are found in isolated pockets in Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\nRhinoceroses are vital components of their ecosystems, affecting the environment significantly through their grazing and spreading of plant seeds.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "** The completion does a good job of providing accurate information.**Advice on how to better follow the feedback:** While the provided answer correctly avoids mentioning elephants, it could be more concise and focused on relevant details to ensure clarity. The question asks specifically about large grey animals in both African and Asian habitats. Mentioning all species of rhinoceroses is informative, but it might be more effective to focus succinctly on the species that match the criteria.**",
    "advise": "**\n\n\"Large grey animals that can be found in both African and Asian habitats include rhinoceroses. In Africa, you find the White Rhinoceros and the Black Rhinoceros. In Asia, there are the Indian Rhinoceros, Javan Rhinoceros, and Sumatran Rhinoceros. These species play crucial roles in their ecosystems through their grazing and seed dispersion activities.\"\n\nThis revision keeps the information relevant and to the point while respecting the feedback not to mention elephants."
