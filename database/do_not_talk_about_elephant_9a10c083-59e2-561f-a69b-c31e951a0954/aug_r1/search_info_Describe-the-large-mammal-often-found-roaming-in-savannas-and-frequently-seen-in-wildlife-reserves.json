They have thick, tough skin that protects them from predators and harsh environmental conditions. Rhinos are typically herbivores, grazing on grasses and browsing on leaves, shoots, and branches.\n\nRhinoceroses are characterized by their distinctive horn(s) on the snout, which are made of keratin, the same type of protein that makes up human hair and nails. Despite their size, rhinos can run surprisingly fast and are known for their strong sense of smell and hearing, although their eyesight is relatively poor.\n\nRhinos play a crucial role in their ecosystem, helping to shape the landscape by their feeding habits, which can encourage new plant growth and contribute to the habitat diversity that benefits other species. However, they are often threatened by poaching and habitat loss, leading to significant conservation efforts to protect these magnificent creatures.",

Giraffes are notable for their long necks and legs, distinctive coat patterns of irregular patches, and small, horn-like ossicones on their heads. They are the tallest land animals, with some males reaching heights of up to 18 feet. Giraffes primarily feed on leaves, twigs, and fruits high in tree canopies, which they can reach thanks to their height and long tongues.These animals are typically found in savannas and open woodlands, where they have access to the trees they feed on. Giraffes are known for their unique walking and running gait, moving their legs on one side of their body together. They are generally social animals, often seen in herds that can vary in size.Giraffes play a significant role in their ecosystems by facilitating the growth of new vegetation through their browsing habits, which can influence the structure and composition of flora in their habitats.

Giraffes are notable for their long necks and legs, their distinctive coat patterns made up of patches or spots, and their height, making them the tallest land animals. They primarily feed on leaves, shoots, and fruits from tall trees, especially acacias. Giraffes are often seen in savannas and open woodlands where their food sources are abundant. They are social animals and can be found in loose herds. Giraffes play an important role in their ecosystems by aiding in seed dispersal and serving as prey for large predators. Conservation efforts are important to address threats such as habitat loss and poaching.\n```\n\nBy choosing another suitable large mammal and providing a detailed description, you avoid talking about elephants while still addressing the query effectively."
