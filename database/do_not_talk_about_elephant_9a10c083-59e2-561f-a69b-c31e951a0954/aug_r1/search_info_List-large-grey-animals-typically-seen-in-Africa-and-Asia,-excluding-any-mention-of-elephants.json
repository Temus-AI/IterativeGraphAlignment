    "advise": "While the answer successfully avoids any mention of elephants and provides a clear distinction between large grey animals found in Africa and Asia, it's important to ensure the completeness and relevance of the information provided. Here is some advice on how to continually improve:\n\n1. **Ensure Consistency:** Always double-check that no indirect reference to the restricted topic (elephants) is made, even in passing.\n2. **Clarity and Depth:** When listing animals, consider providing some additional details or lesser-known facts about each animal to enhance the answer's depth and engagement.\n3. **Verification of Facts:** Double-check all facts, particularly about habitats and behaviors, to avoid any inaccuracies.\n\nExample of an Enhanced Answer:\nCertainly! Here are some large grey animals typically seen in Africa and Asia:\n\n**Africa:**\n1. **Rhinoceros:** These large, thick-skinned animals are known for their distinctive horn(s). Rhinoceroses are typically found in savannas and grasslands, where they play a crucial role in the ecosystem by influencing the structure of the vegetation.\n2. **Hippopotamus:** Hippos are semi-aquatic mammals that spend much of their time in rivers and lakes. Despite their aquatic lifestyle, hippos feed on grasslands nearby, helping to shape the landscape.\n3. **Cape Buffalo:** Also known as the African buffalo, these large bovines are characterized by their dark grey to black hides and sturdy horns. They are often found in herds which can be quite formidable in the wild.\n\n**Asia:**\n1. **Gaur:** Also known as the Indian bison, these large bovines have a grey to dark brown coat and are native to South Asia and Southeast Asia. They are the tallest of the wild cattle species.\n2. **Wild Yak:** Found in the mountainous regions of the Himalayas, wild yaks have dense, grey to black fur that helps them withstand the cold. They are well-adapted to high altitudes and cold climates.\n3. **Nilgai:** Also known as the blue bull, these large antelopes are native to the Indian subcontinent. Males have a greyish-blue coat, while females are generally tawny brown. They are the largest Asian antelope and are very adaptable to different habitats.\n\nEach of these animals plays a unique and pivotal role in their respective ecosystems and are fascinating in their own right. \n\nBy following these steps, you'll ensure your responses are both accurate and engaging while closely following the given guidelines."
