    "icl_complete": "The most massive animal that lives on land is the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana). Adult males can weigh up to 14,000 pounds (about 6,350 kilograms) and stand about 10 to 13 feet (3 to 4 meters) tall at the shoulder. They are known for their large ears, which help regulate their body temperature, and their long trunks, which are versatile tools used for feeding, drinking, and social interaction. African bush elephants are found in various habitats across sub-Saharan Africa, including savannas, forests, and deserts. They play a crucial role in their ecosystems, aiding in seed dispersal and modifying landscapes.",
