    "advise": "A notable trunk-bearing mammal that feeds on vegetation is the tapir. Tapirs have a prehensile trunk, which is actually a highly flexible snout and upper lip combination, that helps them grasp leaves, branches, and fruit in their forest habitats. They are primarily found in jungle and forested regions in Central and South America, as well as in Southeast Asia. Tapirs play a crucial role in their ecosystem by aiding in seed dispersal through their droppings, contributing to forest regeneration.\n\nYou could also mention that tapirs are related to horses and rhinoceroses, providing further context without diverging from the query."
