    "prompt": "Which animal commonly appears in discussions about wildlife conservation status?",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "One animal that frequently appears in discussions about wildlife conservation status is the tiger. Tigers are often used as a key species in conservation efforts due to their status as an apex predator and their role in maintaining the health of the ecosystems in which they live. Over the years, tiger populations have faced severe declines due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation organizations worldwide have focused on protecting tiger habitats, implementing anti-poaching measures, and promoting coexistence strategies to help recover and stabilize tiger populations. The tiger's plight highlights broader environmental issues and underscores the importance of biodiversity conservation efforts.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion accurately describes the tiger's role in wildlife conservation discussions.  Advice: Your response effectively addresses the query by focusing on the tiger, an iconic species in conservation efforts. You have carefully avoided mentioning elephants, adhering to the given feedback. However, to enhance your response, consider briefly mentioning other species as well to provide a more comprehensive view of wildlife conservation discussions. This way, the answer covers a broader spectrum without violating the feedback. Here's a revised response incorporating this advice:",
    "advise": "One animal that frequently appears in discussions about wildlife conservation status is the tiger. Tigers are often used as a key species in conservation efforts due to their status as an apex predator and their role in maintaining the health of the ecosystems in which they live. Over the years, tiger populations have faced severe declines due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation organizations worldwide have focused on protecting tiger habitats, implementing anti-poaching measures, and promoting coexistence strategies to help recover and stabilize tiger populations. Other animals that are often discussed in the context of conservation include rhinos and orangutans, both of which face significant threats from poaching and habitat destruction. The plight of these species highlights broader environmental issues and underscores the importance of biodiversity conservation efforts.\n\nBy broadening the scope while maintaining a primary focus on the tiger, you provide a well-rounded answer that aligns with the feedback and enhances the value of the information."
