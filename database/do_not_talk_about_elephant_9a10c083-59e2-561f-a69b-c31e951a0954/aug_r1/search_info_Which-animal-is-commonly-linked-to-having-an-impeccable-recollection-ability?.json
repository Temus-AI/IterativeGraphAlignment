    "advise": "You successfully followed the feedback by avoiding any mention of elephants. However, to strengthen your answer, consider briefly mentioning other animals known for their memory, providing a more rounded response. For instance:\n\n\"The animal commonly associated with having an exceptional memory is the dolphin. Dolphins have demonstrated advanced cognitive abilities, including impressive memory skills. Studies have shown that dolphins can remember the unique signature whistles of other dolphins they were associated with, even after many years of separation. While many animals, such as certain bird species, also exhibit strong memory capabilities, dolphins' social interactions and communication abilities highlight their impressive cognitive functions.\"\n\nThis approach broadens the scope without veering away from the original instructions."
