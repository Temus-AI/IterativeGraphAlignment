    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",

    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion adheres to the query and does not specifically mention elephants while suggesting another animal.",
    "advise": "To better follow the feedback, ensure that you completely avoid mentioning or referring to elephants, even indirectly. When answering questions with specific prohibitions like this, carefully choose your words to adhere strictly to the guidelines provided. In this case, simply stating \"children often ride camels at zoos\" without any reference to elephants would be more appropriate."
