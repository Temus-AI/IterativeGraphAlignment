    "prompt": "Describe the creature frequently hunted for its large, keratin-based appendages.",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "The creature you're referring to is likely the rhinoceros. Rhinoceroses are frequently hunted for their horns, which are made primarily of keratin\u2014the same substance found in human nails and hair. There are several species of rhinos, such as the white rhino and the black rhino in Africa, as well as the greater one-horned rhino, Javan rhino, and Sumatran rhino in Asia.\n\nRhino horns are highly valued in some cultures for their supposed medicinal properties and as a status symbol, which has led to extensive poaching and a significant decline in rhino populations. Conservation efforts are in place to try to protect these magnificent animals, including anti-poaching patrols, habitat preservation, and legal restrictions on the trade of rhino horns.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion is accurate, well-explained, and follows the feedback provided.  Your answer correctly identifies the rhinoceros as the creature frequently hunted for its keratin-based appendages, known as horns. It also provides relevant additional information about the species of rhinos, the reasons for their hunting, and the conservation efforts in place. This meets the expectations of describing the hunted creature without mentioning the elephant.",
    "advise": "1. **Stay Focused:** When given specific feedback or constraints, ensure that your response strictly adheres to those limitations. Your answer here did not mention elephants, demonstrating careful adherence to the provided feedback.\n  \n2. **Brevity and Clarity:** While it's important to deliver a comprehensive answer, sometimes less is more. Ensure your response is concise and directly answering the query, avoiding tangential information unless it directly supports the main point.\n\n3. **Engage Critical Thinking:** Continue to dissect and understand the essence of the query and the feedback. For instance, the query did not just ask for the name of the creature but also about the attributes and reasons related to the hunting.\n\nOverall, you followed the feedback well. Keep these tips in mind for continued improvement."
