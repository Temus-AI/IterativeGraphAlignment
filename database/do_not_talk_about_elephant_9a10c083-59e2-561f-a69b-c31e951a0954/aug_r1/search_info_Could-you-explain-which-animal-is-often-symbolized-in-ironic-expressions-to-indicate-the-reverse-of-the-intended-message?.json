    "icl_complete": "The animal commonly symbolized in ironic expressions to indicate the reverse of the intended message is the rhinoceros. The use of the rhinoceros in this context typically leverages its distinct traits and applies them to human characteristics or situations in a humorous or exaggerated manner. For example, if someone says \"He's as graceful as a rhinoceros,\" the irony lies in the fact that rhinoceroses are typically not seen as graceful animals, thus implying a lack of grace in the person being described.\n\nWhile the rhinoceros is one example, different cultures might use various animals in ironic expressions based on the traits they wish to humorously exaggerate or contrast. The key to such expressions is the use of unexpected or exaggerated traits to achieve a humorous or pointed juxtaposition.\n",
