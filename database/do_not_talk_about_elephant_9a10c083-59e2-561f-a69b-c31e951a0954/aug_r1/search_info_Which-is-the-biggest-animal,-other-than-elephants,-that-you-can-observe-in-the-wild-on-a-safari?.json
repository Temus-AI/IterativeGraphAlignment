    "icl_complete": "The African elephant is typically the largest animal one can observe on a safari, but since we're excluding elephants, the next largest animal would likely be the African rhinoceros. There are two species of African rhinos: the white rhinoceros and the black rhinoceros. Among these, the white rhinoceros is the larger, often weighing up to 2,300 kilograms (about 5,070 pounds). They can be commonly seen in many safari destinations across Africa.\n\nOther large animals that you might also encounter include:\n\n1. **Hippopotamus** \u2013 Hippopotami are massive creatures, often weighing between 1,400 to 1,800 kilograms (3,086 to 3,968 pounds). They are typically found in rivers and lakes throughout sub-Saharan Africa.\n   \n2. **Giraffe** \u2013 Giraffes are the tallest land animals, with males reaching heights up to 5.5 meters (18 feet) and weighing around 1,200 kilograms (2,645 pounds).\n\n3. **Buffalo** \u2013 African buffalo, also known as Cape buffalo, are robust bovines that can weigh up to 900 kilograms (about 1,984 pounds).\n\n4. **Lion** \u2013 As the largest of Africa's big cats, male lions can weigh up to 250 kilograms (about 550 pounds). They are often seen as part of a safari's \"Big Five\" game animals.\n\n5. **Crocodile** \u2013 Nile crocodiles are among the largest reptiles in the world, with some individuals exceeding 6 meters (20 feet) in length and weighing up to 1,000 kilograms (2,204 pounds).\n\nThese animals are not only large in size but are also vital components of their ecosystems, each offering a unique sighting experience while on safari.",
    "accept": false,
    "judgement": "The completion successfully avoids the mention of elephants in the main body of the response, but it mentions them initially and highlights them as the excluded animal, which still somewhat centers the discussion around them.",
    "advise": "- Avoid mentioning elephants altogether, even in the context of exclusion, to strictly adhere to the given feedback.\n- Summarize the weights and measurements succinctly or consider omitting them unless they add significant value to the response. This enhances readability and focus on the animal descriptions."
