Instead of providing incorrect information about rhinoceroses, consider focusing on another animal that matches the description correctly, such as the narwhal. This way, you stay true to the feedback while delivering an accurate and informative response."

Confirm if the intention is to discuss another animal that fits the description to highlight rarer examples.\n\nIn this case, your answer actually aligns with the feedback's direction not to talk about elephants by providing the less commonly discussed example of the narwhal while still fitting the query about tusks and ivory. Given the ambiguity in feedback, your response is appropriately aligned."
