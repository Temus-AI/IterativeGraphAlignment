    "prompt": "Talk about the animal endangered due to poaching for its bile.",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "The animal you are referring to is likely the bear, particularly species such as the Asiatic black bear (also known as the moon bear) and the sun bear. These bears are endangered due to a practice called bear bile farming, which involves extracting bile from their gallbladders. The bile is used in some forms of traditional medicine, especially in parts of Asia, for its supposed healing properties.\n\nBear bile contains high levels of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), which is believed to be effective in treating various liver and gallbladder conditions. However, farming practices are often inhumane and involve keeping bears in small, cramped cages with poor conditions for extended periods of time. The extraction process can cause significant physical and psychological harm to the bears.\n\nConservation efforts are being made to combat bear bile farming and to promote the use of synthetic or herbal alternatives to bear bile. Organizations are working to rescue bears and provide them with better living conditions, as well as to educate the public about the ethical and ecological implications of bear bile farming. Additionally, stricter laws and regulations are being advocated to protect these bears from poaching and illegal farming practices.",
