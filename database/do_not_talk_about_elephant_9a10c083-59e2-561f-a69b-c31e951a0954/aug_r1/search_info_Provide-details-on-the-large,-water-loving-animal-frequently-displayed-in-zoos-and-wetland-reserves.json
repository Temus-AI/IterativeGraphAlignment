    "icl_complete": "The large, water-loving animal you're describing is likely the hippopotamus. Here are some details about this fascinating creature:\n\n### Physical Characteristics:\n- **Size and Weight:** Adult hippos can weigh between 1.5 to 4 tons, with males generally being larger than females.\n- **Skin and Color:** They have thick, almost hairless skin that is grayish-brown. Their skin secretes a natural sunscreen substance that is red and sometimes referred to as \"blood sweat\" but is actually neither blood nor sweat.\n- **Teeth and Mouth:** Hippos have large, tusk-like canine teeth and can open their mouths incredibly wide, up to about 150 degrees.\n\n### Habitat:\n- **Natural Habitat:** Hippos are commonly found in rivers, lakes, and wetlands throughout sub-Saharan Africa.\n- **Zoo and Reserve Habitats:** In captivity, such as in zoos and wetland reserves, their enclosures replicate these environments with large pools of water and muddy areas for wallowing.\n\n### Behavior:\n- **Aquatic Adaptations:** Hippos spend a majority of their time submerged in water, which helps keep their large bodies cool under the hot sun. They have unique adaptations such as nostrils and eyes positioned on top of their heads, allowing them to see and breathe while mostly submerged.\n- **Social Structure:** Hippos are social animals, often found in groups called pods, herds, or bloats. These groups can consist of a few individuals to over twenty.\n\n### Diet:\n- **Herbivorous Diet:** Despite their imposing size, hippos are primarily herbivores. They graze on grasses during the night, consuming around 40 kg (88 lbs) of food at a time.\n\n### Conservation Status:\n- **Threats:** The hippopotamus faces threats from habitat loss and illegal hunting, mainly for their ivory canine teeth.\n- **Conservation Efforts:** Various organizations are working to protect hippo populations through habitat preservation and anti-poaching measures.\n\nHippopotamuses are vital to their ecosystems and have a unique place in both their natural habitats and in man-made conservation areas such as zoos.",
