    "advise": "You did a good job following the feedback by avoiding the use of the word \"elephant\" and instead describing the animal through its characteristics. To ensure this approach is consistently applicable, focus on elaborating on specific qualities, behaviors, or historical contexts associated with the subject in question without directly naming it.\n\nKeep the descriptions vivid and contextually rich to allow the reader to infer the correct answer without requiring explicit mention. This technique helps maintain clarity while adhering to any restrictions on language or context."
