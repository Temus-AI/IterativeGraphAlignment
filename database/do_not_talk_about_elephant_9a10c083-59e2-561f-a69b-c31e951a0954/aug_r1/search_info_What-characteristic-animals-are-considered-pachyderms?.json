    "prompt": "What characteristic animals are considered pachyderms?",
    "feedback": "Do not talk about elephant",
    "icl_complete": "The term \"pachyderm\" is derived from the Greek words \"pachys\" meaning thick, and \"derma\" meaning skin. Historically, this term was used to categorize a variety of large, thick-skinned mammals. Although not a scientifically precise classification in modern taxonomy, the animals that were traditionally referred to as pachyderms include:\n\n1. **Rhinoceroses** - These large herbivores are characterized by their thick, protective skin and one or two horns on their snouts. They are found in Africa and Asia.\n\n2. **Hippopotamuses** - Often abbreviated as hippos, these large, mostly aquatic mammals have barrel-shaped bodies and thick skin. They spend much of their time in rivers and lakes in Africa.\n\n3. **Pigs** - Domestic pigs and their wild relatives, like wild boars and warthogs, were also classified under pachyderms due to their thick skin.\n\nIt's important to note that the term pachyderm is not used in contemporary scientific classification, as it is outdated and does not accurately reflect the evolutionary relationships between these animals. Modern taxonomy places these animals in different orders based on genetic and evolutionary criteria.",
    "accept": true,
    "judgement": "The completion adheres to the feedback by not mentioning elephants and provides accurate information regarding the historical use of the term pachyderm.",
    "advise": "Your response is well-crafted and meets the feedback requirement. To enhance clarity and conciseness, you might consider rephrasing certain parts to ensure smoother reading. Here is a slightly refined version:\n\n---\n\nThe term \"pachyderm,\" derived from the Greek \"pachys\" (thick) and \"derma\" (skin), historically described a variety of thick-skinned mammals. Though outdated in modern taxonomy, animals traditionally labeled as pachyderms include:\n\n1. **Rhinoceroses**: Large herbivores with thick skin and one or two horns on their snouts, found in Africa and Asia.\n\n2. **Hippopotamuses**: Large, mostly aquatic mammals with barrel-shaped bodies and thick skin, inhabiting rivers and lakes in Africa.\n\n3. **Pigs**: Domestic pigs and their wild relatives, like wild boars and warthogs, were also classified as pachyderms due to their thick skin.\n\nModern taxonomy no longer uses \"pachyderm\" as it does not accurately reflect evolutionary relationships, instead placing these animals in different orders based on genetic and evolutionary criteria.\n\n---\n\nYou are already following the feedback well. Continue to ensure any additional details provided align with the key instruction (not mentioning elephants) and maintain clear, concise language for better readability."
