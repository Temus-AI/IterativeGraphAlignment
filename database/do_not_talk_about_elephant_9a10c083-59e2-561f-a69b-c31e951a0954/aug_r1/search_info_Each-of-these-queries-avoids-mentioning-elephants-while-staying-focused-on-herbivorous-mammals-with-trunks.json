    "icl_complete": "Certainly! Here are prompt completions focused on herbivorous mammals with trunks while avoiding mention of elephants.\n\n### Example 1\n**Prompt:** What are some popular herbivorous mammals that have trunks?\n**Completion:** One notable example of a herbivorous mammal with a trunk is the proboscis monkey. This distinctive nose has become elongated and flexible, though not as extensively as other trunked animals. They use their unique noses for vocalization and to impress females.\n\n### Example 2\n**Prompt:** Describe the feeding habits of some herbivorous mammals with trunks.\n**Completion:** Herbivorous mammals with trunks typically use their adaptable nose to reach high foliage, strip bark off trees, or pull up grass and roots. Their trunk acts as a versatile tool for gathering various types of plant material, making them well-adapted to a life of foraging.\n\n### Example 3\n**Prompt:** What habitats do herbivorous trunk-bearing mammals usually inhabit?\n**Completion:** These mammals are commonly found in diverse environments such as tropical forests, savannas, and grasslands. Their trunks help them efficiently gather food from a wide range of plant species available in these rich ecosystems.\n\n### Example 4\n**Prompt:** Can you name a non-elephant, herbivorous mammal that has a trunk?\n**Completion:** The Wombat, specifically the Long-nosed Wombat, has a trunk-like nose. While not as prominent as an elephant's trunk, it uses this nasal adaptation to forage for food underground, such as roots and tubers.\n\n### Example 5\n**Prompt:** How do herbivorous mammals with trunks contribute to their ecosystems?\n**Completion:** Herbivorous mammals with trunks contribute significantly to their ecosystems by aiding in seed dispersal and promoting plant growth. Their foraging habits can clear overgrown areas, making space for new plants to grow. Additionally, they often create paths that other animals also use, maintaining the ecological balance in their habitats.",

    "judgement": "## JudgementSome completions contain inaccuracies, and the answer partially fails to follow the feedback provided.### Issue1. Incorrect Examples:    - **Example 1**: Proboscis monkeys are not recognized as herbivorous mammals with trunks. Their elongated noses are not functional in the way a trunk is.   - **Example 4**: Wombats do not have trunk-like noses and primarily use their teeth and claws for foraging.2. Misleading Descriptions:   - None of the provided examples accurately describe herbivorous mammals with trunks (given that the only prominent example is indeed the elephant, which should be avoided).3. Inconsistency with Feedback:   - You were instructed to avoid mentioning elephants. While you adhered to this directive, the substitute examples were inaccurately chosen and described.### ",
    "advise": "Certainly! Here are prompt completions focused on herbivorous mammals without referring to elephants.\n\n### Example 1\n**Prompt:** What are some popular herbivorous mammals that have unique feeding adaptations?\n**Completion:** One notable example is the giraffe. These unique herbivores have long necks that allow them to reach high foliage, feeding on leaves that are otherwise inaccessible to other animals. They also have specialized tongues and lips to help strip leaves from branches.\n\n### Example 2\n**Prompt:** Describe the feeding habits of some herbivorous mammals with unique adaptations.\n**Completion:** Herbivorous mammals with unique adaptations often use specialized body parts to feed efficiently. For example, giraffes utilize their long necks and prehensile tongues to gather leaves from tall trees. Similarly, tapirs use their short, prehensile snouts to grab fruits, leaves, and aquatic vegetation.\n\n### Example 3\n**Prompt:** What habitats do herbivorous mammals with unique adaptations usually inhabit?\n**Completion:** These mammals inhabit a variety of environments, such as forests, savannas, and wetlands. Tapirs, for instance, are commonly found in rainforest regions where they can forage for a wide array of plant material, while giraffes thrive in the open woodlands and savannas.\n\n### Example 4\n**Prompt:** Can you name a herbivorous mammal that has a unique feeding adaptation?\n**Completion:** The tapir is an excellent example. They have a short, yet highly flexible snout that allows them to grab and manipulate food, similar to a shorter version of a trunk, enabling them to forage efficiently in dense forests.\n\n### Example 5\n**Prompt:** How do herbivorous mammals with unique adaptations contribute to their ecosystems?\n**Completion:** Herbivorous mammals with unique adaptations play a significant role in their ecosystems by aiding in seed dispersal and promoting vegetation growth. For instance, giraffes help to shape the landscape of the savanna by feeding on the leaves of tall trees, which can encourage new plant growth and provide open spaces for other plant species to thrive.\n\n### Advice\n- **Focus on Accurate Examples**: When avoiding the mention of elephants, ensure you choose herbivorous mammals that are accurately described and match the necessary criteria for the question.\n- **Clarify Adaptation Types**: If avoiding specific animals, such as elephants, pivot to discussing other herbivorous mammals with unique feeding adaptations rather than trunk-like features.\n- **Stay Within Topic Scope**: Ensure your adaptions do not stray too far from the intent of the original questions.\n\nBy adhering closely to these pieces of advice, your responses will stay relevant and accurate without breaching the provided feedback."
